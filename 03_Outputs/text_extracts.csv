Fellow Shareholders:
Last year was extraordinary in so many ways. Throughout my more-than-35-year
career, there have always been disruptions, but this year saw a healthcare crisis that had
a personal impact on millions. The contrast between the hardship imposed on all those
affected by COVID-19 and the very high level of market activity created a stark and
complex environment for all of us at Goldman Sachs to navigate.

The pandemic put enormous strain on everyone, from families caring for relatives they couldn’t visit in person to
small-business owners forced to cut back their livelihoods. And though I was pleased to see central banks and
governments take swift action to support their economies, no amount of monetary or fiscal stimulus could make
up for the millions of lives lost or upended by the virus.

As I write this letter, we’re still working to get past the pandemic, but we feel encouraged by what we see. Several
vaccines have been approved for use, and though the rollout was slow at first, we continue to make headway.
Public-health officials are closely monitoring the spread of more contagious variants. But the global economy has
recovered considerably since its decline last spring, and now life after the pandemic is coming into view.

Many times in our 152-year history, we’ve adapted, with remarkable speed, to the new and unexpected, but I was truly
amazed by our people in 2020. Time and again, they showed the creativity and resilience that make Goldman Sachs
unique. As a result, I’m proud to report that, even during a tumultuous and at times deeply trying year, our firm
delivered strong financial performance, while also supporting the larger COVID-19 relief effort for the communities
in which we live and work around the world.

For all of this year’s upheaval, we distinguished ourselves by staying the course. We never lost sight of our purpose:
to advance sustainable economic growth and financial opportunity. And when our clients turned to us in need,
we demonstrated the core values that have always guided us: partnership, client service, integrity, and excellence.

I was also determined to resolve the matter surrounding 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). Although I am
glad to have put it behind us, I see many lessons for the future. Notably, the behavior of a few can do harm to our
franchise, and we are responsible for each other’s actions. And so our organization will continue to make sure all
of us operate at the highest level of integrity.




                                                                                                              Goldman Sachs 2020 Annual Report   1

Introduction

Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Across the globe, 2023 was yet another year of significant challenges, from the
terrible ongoing wars and violence in the Middle East and Ukraine to mounting
terrorist activity and growing geopolitical tensions, importantly with China. Almost all
nations felt the effects last year of global economic uncertainty, including higher
energy and food prices, inflation rates and volatile markets. While all these events
and associated instability have serious ramifications on our company, colleagues,
clients and countries where we do business, their consequences on the world at large
— with the extreme suffering of the Ukrainian people, escalating tragedy in the
Middle East and the potential restructuring of the global order — are far more
important.

As these events unfold, America’s global leadership role is being challenged outside
by other nations and inside by our polarized electorate. We need to find ways to put
aside our differences and work in partnership with other Western nations in the
name of democracy. During this time of great crises, uniting to protect our essential
freedoms, including free enterprise, is paramount. We should remember that
America, “conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are
created equal,” still remains a shining beacon of hope to citizens around the world.
JPMorgan Chase, a company that historically has worked across borders and
boundaries, will do its part to ensure that the global economy is safe and secure.

In spite of the unsettling landscape, including last year’s regional bank turmoil, the
U.S. economy continues to be resilient, with consumers still spending, and the
markets currently expect a soft landing. It is important to note that the economy is
being fueled by large amounts of government deficit spending and past stimulus.
There is also a growing need for increased spending as we continue transitioning to
a greener economy, restructuring global supply chains, boosting military expenditure
and battling rising healthcare costs. This may lead to stickier inflation and higher
rates than markets expect. Furthermore, there are downside risks to watch.
Quantitative tightening is draining more than $900 billion in liquidity from the
system annually — and we have never truly experienced the full effect of quantitative
tightening on this scale. Plus the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East
continue to have the potential to disrupt energy and food markets, migration, and
military and economic relationships, in addition to their dreadful human cost. These
significant and somewhat unprecedented forces cause us to remain cautious.

2023 was another strong year for JPMorgan Chase, with our firm generating record
revenue for the sixth consecutive year, as well as setting numerous records in each of
our lines of business. We earned revenue in 2023 of $162.4 billion1 and net income of

$49.6 billion, with return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of 21%, reflecting
strong underlying performance across our businesses. We also increased our
quarterly common dividend of $1.00 per share to $1.05 per share in the third quarter
of 2023 — and again to $1.15 per share in the first quarter of 2024 — while
continuing to reinforce our fortress balance sheet. We grew market share in several
of our businesses and continued to make significant investments in products, people
and technology while exercising strict risk disciplines.

Throughout the year, we demonstrated the power of our investment philosophy and
guiding principles, as well as the value of being there for clients — as we always are
— in both good times and bad times. The result was continued growth broadly
across the firm. We will highlight a few examples from 2023: Consumer &
Community Banking (CCB) extended its #1 leadership positions and grew share year-
over-year in retail deposits, credit card sales and credit card outstandings (adding
close to 3.6 million net new customers to the franchise); the Corporate & Investment
Bank (CIB) maintained its #1 rank in both Investment Banking and Markets and
gained more than 100 basis points of Investment Banking market share; Commercial
Banking (CB) added over 5,000 new relationships (excluding First Republic Bank),
roughly doubling the prior year’s achievement; and Asset & Wealth Management
(AWM) saw record client asset net inflows of $490 billion, over 20% higher than its
prior record.

In 2023, we continued to play a forceful and essential role in advancing economic
growth. In total, we extended credit and raised capital totaling $2.3 trillion for our
consumer and institutional clients around the world. On a daily basis, we move nearly
$10 trillion in over 120 currencies and more than 160 countries, as well as safeguard
over $32 trillion in assets. By purchasing First Republic Bank, we brought much-
needed stability to the U.S. banking system while allowing us to give a new, secure
home to over half a million First Republic customers.

As always, we hold fast to our commitment to corporate responsibility, including
helping to create a stronger, more inclusive economy — from supporting work skills
training programs around the world to financing affordable housing and small
businesses to making investments in cities like Detroit that show how business and
government leaders can work together to solve problems.

We have achieved our decades-long consistency by adhering to our key principles
and strategies (see sidebar on Steadfast Principles below), which allow us to drive
good organic growth and promote proper management of our capital (including
dividends and stock buybacks). The charts below show our performance results and
illustrate how we have grown our franchises, how we compare with our competitors
and how we look at our fortress balance sheet. Please peruse them and the CEO
letters in this Annual Report, all of which provide specific details about our
businesses and our plans for the future.

STEADFAST PRINCIPLES WORTH REPEATING (AND ONE NEW ONE)

Looking back on the past two+ decades — starting from my time as Chairman and
CEO of Bank One in 2000 — there is one common theme: our unwavering dedication
to help clients, communities and countries throughout the world. It is clear that our
financial discipline, constant investment in innovation and ongoing development of
our people have enabled us to achieve this consistency and commitment. In addition,
across the firm, we uphold certain steadfast tenets that are worth repeating.

First, our work has very real human impact. While JPMorgan Chase stock is owned by
large institutions, pension plans, mutual funds and directly by single investors, in
almost all cases the ultimate beneficiaries are individuals in our communities. More
than 100 million people in the United States own stocks; many, in one way or
another, own JPMorgan Chase stock. Frequently, these shareholders are veterans,
teachers, police officers, firefighters, healthcare workers, retirees, or those saving for
a home, education or retirement. Often, our employees also bank these shareholders,
as well as their families and their companies. Your management team goes to work
every day recognizing the enormous responsibility that we have to all of our
shareholders.

Second, shareholder value can be built only if you maintain a healthy and vibrant
company, which means doing a good job of taking care of your customers,
employees and communities. Conversely, how can you have a healthy company if
you neglect any of these stakeholders? As we have learned over the past few years,
there are myriad ways an institution can demonstrate its compassion for its
employees and its communities while still strengthening shareholder value.

Third, while we don’t run the company worrying about the stock price in the short
run, in the long run we consider our stock price a measure of our progress over time.
This progress is a function of continual investments in our people, systems and
products, in good and bad times, to build our capabilities. These important
investments will also drive our company’s future prospects and position it to grow
and prosper for decades. Measured by stock performance, our progress is
exceptional. For example, whether looking back 10 years or even farther to 2004,
when the JPMorgan Chase/Bank One merger took place, we have outperformed the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and the Standard & Poor’s Financials Index.

Fourth, we are united behind basic principles and strategies (you can see the
principles for How We Do Business on our website and our Purpose statement in my
letter from last year) that have helped build this company and made it thrive. These
allow us to maintain a fortress balance sheet, constantly invest and nurture talent,
fully satisfy regulators, continually improve risk, governance and controls, and serve
customers and clients while lifting up communities worldwide. This philosophy is
embedded in our company culture and influences nearly every role in the firm.

Fifth, we strive to build enduring businesses, which rely on and benefit from one
another, but we are not a conglomerate. This structure helps generate our superior
returns. Nonetheless, despite our best efforts, the walls that protect this company are
not particularly high — and we face extraordinary competition. I have written about
this reality extensively in the past and cover it again in this letter. We recognize our
strengths and vulnerabilities, and we play our hand as best we can.

Sixth, and this is the new one, we must be a source of strength, particularly in tough
times, for our clients and the countries in which we operate. We must take seriously
our role as one of the guardians of the world’s financial systems.

Seventh, we operate with a very important silent partner — the U.S. government —
noting as my friend Warren Buffett points out that his company’s success is
predicated upon the extraordinary conditions our country creates. He is right to say
to his shareholders that when they see the American flag, they all should say thank
you. We should, too. JPMorgan Chase is a healthy and thriving company, and we
always want to give back and pay our fair share. We do pay our fair share — and we
want it to be spent well and have the greatest impact. To give you an idea of where
our taxes and fees go: In the last 10 years, we paid more than $46 billion in federal,
state and local taxes in the United States and over $22 billion in taxes outside of the
United States. Additionally, we paid the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation over
$10 billion so that it has the resources to cover failure in the American banking
sector. Our partner — the federal government — also imposes significant regulations
upon us, and it is imperative that we meet all legal and regulatory requirements
imposed on our company.

Eighth and finally, we know the foundation of our success rests with our people. They
are the front line, both individually and as teams, serving our customers and
communities, building the technology, making the strategic decisions, managing the
risks, determining our investments and driving innovation. However you view the
world — its complexity, risks and opportunities — a company’s prosperity requires a
great team of people with guts, brains, integrity, enormous capabilities and high
standards of professional excellence to ensure its ongoing success.
I remain proud of our company’s resiliency and of what our hundreds of thousands
of employees around the world have achieved, collectively and individually.
Throughout these challenging past few years, we have never stopped doing all the
things we should be doing to serve our clients and our communities. As you know,
we are champions of banking’s essential role in a community — its potential for
bringing people together, for enabling companies and individuals to attain their
goals, and for being a source of strength in difficult times. I often remind our
employees that the work we do matters and has impact. United by our principles and
purpose, we help people and institutions finance and achieve their aspirations, lifting
up individuals, homeowners, small businesses, larger corporations, schools, hospitals,

cities and countries in all regions of the world. What we have accomplished in the 20
years since the Bank One and JPMorgan Chase merger is evidence of the importance
of our values.

CELEBRATING THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BANK ONE/JPMORGAN
CHASE MERGER

J.P. Morgan Chase

By 2004, J.P. Morgan Chase already represented the consolidation of four of the 10
largest U.S. banks from 1990: The Chase Manhattan Corp., Manufacturers Hanover,
Chemical Banking Corp. and, most recently, J.P. Morgan & Company. And some of
their predecessor companies stretched back into the 1800s, one even into the late
1700s.

Bank One

Bank One had been even busier on the acquisition front, especially across the United
States. By 1998, then Banc One had more than 1,300 branches in 12 states when it
announced a merger with First Chicago NBD, a Chicago-based bank created just
three years earlier by the merger of First Chicago and Detroit-based NBD. Now
headquartered in Chicago, the new Bank One became the largest bank in the
Midwest, second largest among credit card companies and fourth largest in the
United States. But the merger didn’t go as planned, with Bank One issuing three
different earnings warnings. In March 2000, Bank One reached outside its executive
ranks, and my tenure began as Chairman and CEO, working to overhaul the company
and help bring it back to profitability and growth.

The story begins ... A merger 20 years ago helped transform two giant banks

Fast forward to 2003, and another wave of consolidation was well underway in U.S.
banking. Most of the nation’s larger banks were trying to position themselves to be
an “endgame winner.” In the biggest deal, Bank of America agreed to buy
FleetBoston Financial Corp. for more than $40 billion. Those two banks — already
amalgamations of several predecessor companies — touted the breadth of their
combined retail branch network.

But they were hardly alone. In 2003, some 215 deals were announced among U.S.
commercial banks and bank holding companies for a total value of $66 billion,
according to Thomson Financial, which tracks merger data.

In July 2004, J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank One merged — as part of a 225-year
journey — to form this exceptional company of ours: JPMorgan Chase. At its merger
in 2004, the combined bank was the fourth largest bank in the world by market
capitalization. But with patient groundwork over the years — fixing systems and
upgrading technology, managing the notable acquisitions of Bear Stearns and
Washington Mutual (WaMu) and continuing to reinvest, including in our talent — we
have made our company an endgame winner.

In earlier years, banks worried about their survival. While the past two decades have
brought some virtually unprecedented challenges, including the great financial crisis

and a pandemic followed by a global shutdown, they did not stop us from
accomplishing extraordinary things. Our bank has now emerged as the #1 bank by
market capitalization.

Each of our businesses is among the best in the world, with increased market share,
strong financial results and an unwavering focus on serving our clients, communities
and shareholders with distinction and dedication. The strengths that are embedded
in JPMorgan Chase — the knowledge and cohesiveness of our people, our long-
standing client relationships, our technology and product capabilities, our presence
in more than 100 countries and our unquestionable fortress balance sheet — would
be hard to replicate. Crucially, the strength of our company has allowed us to always
be there for clients, governments and communities — in good times and in bad
times — and this strength has enabled us to continually invest in building our
businesses for the future.

You can see from the following charts what gains and improvements we have
achieved along the way.

Update on Specific Issues Facing Our Company
Each year, I try to update you on some of the most important issues facing our
company. First and foremost may well be the impact of artificial intelligence (AI).

While we do not know the full effect or the precise rate at which AI will change our
business — or how it will affect society at large — we are completely convinced the
consequences will be extraordinary and possibly as transformational as some of the
major technological inventions of the past several hundred years: Think the printing
press, the steam engine, electricity, computing and the Internet, among others.

THE CRITICAL IMPACT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

Since the firm first started using AI over a decade ago, and its first mention in my
2017 letter to shareholders, we have grown our AI organization materially. It now
includes more than 2,000 AI/machine learning (ML) experts and data scientists. We
continue to attract some of the best and brightest in this space and have an
exceptional firmwide AI/ML and Research department with deep expertise.

We have been actively using predictive AI and ML for years — and now have over
400 use cases in production in areas such as marketing, fraud and risk — and they
are increasingly driving real business value across our businesses and functions.
We're also exploring the potential that generative AI (GenAI) can unlock across a
range of domains, most notably in software engineering, customer service and
operations, as well as in general employee productivity. In the future, we envision
GenAI helping us reimagine entire business workflows. We will continue to
experiment with these AI and ML capabilities and implement solutions in a safe,
responsible way.

While we are investing more money in our AI capabilities, many of these projects pay
for themselves. Over time, we anticipate that our use of AI has the potential to
augment virtually every job, as well as impact our workforce composition. It may
reduce certain job categories or roles, but it may create others as well. As we have in

the past, we will aggressively retrain and redeploy our talent to make sure we are
taking care of our employees if they are affected by this trend.

Finally, as a global leader across businesses and regions, we have large amounts of
extraordinarily rich data that, together with AI, can fuel better insights and help us
improve how we manage risk and serve our customers. In addition to making sure
our data is high quality and easily accessible, we need to complete the migration of
our analytical data estate to the public cloud. These new data platforms offer high-
performance compute power, which will unlock our ability to use our data in ways
that are hard to contemplate today.

Recognizing the importance of AI to our business, we created a new position
called Chief Data & Analytics Officer that sits on our Operating Committee.

Elevating this new role to the Operating Committee level — reporting directly to
Daniel Pinto and me — reflects how critical this function will be going forward and
how seriously we expect AI to influence our business. This will embed data and
analytics into our decision making at every level of the company. The primary focus is
not just on the technical aspects of AI but also on how all management can — and
should — use it. Each of our lines of business has corresponding data and analytics
roles so we can share best practices, develop reusable solutions that solve multiple
business problems, and continuously learn and improve as the future of AI unfolds.

Clearly, AI comes with many risks, which need to be rigorously managed.

We have a robust, well-established risk and control framework that helps us
proactively stay in front of AI-related risks, particularly as the regulatory landscape
evolves. And we will, of course, continue to work hard with our regulators, clients and
subject matter experts to make sure we maintain the highest ethical standards and
are transparent in how AI helps us make decisions; e.g., to counter bias among other
things.

You may already be aware that there are bad actors using AI to try to infiltrate
companies’ systems to steal money and intellectual property or simply to cause
disruption and damage. For our part, we incorporate AI into our toolset to counter
these threats and proactively detect and mitigate their efforts.

OUR JOURNEY TO THE CLOUD

Getting our technology to the cloud — whether the public cloud or the private cloud
— is essential to fully maximize all of our capabilities, including the power of our
data. The cloud offers many benefits: 1) it accelerates the speed of delivery of new
services; 2) it simultaneously reduces the cost of compute power and enables, when
needed, an extraordinary amount of compute capability — called burst computing;

3) it provides that compute capability across all of our data; and 4) it allows us to be
able to constantly and quickly adopt new technologies because updated cloud
services are continually being added — more so in the public cloud, where we
benefit from the innovation that all cloud providers create, than in the private cloud,
where innovation is only our own.

Of course, we are learning a lot along the way. For example, we know we should
carefully pick which applications and which data go to the public cloud versus the
private cloud because of the expense, security and capabilities required. In addition,
it is critical that we eventually use multiple clouds to avoid lock-in. And we intend to
maintain our own expertise so that we’re never reliant on the expertise of others
even if that requires additional money.

We invested approximately $2 billion to build four new, modern, private cloud-
based, highly reliable and efficient data centers in the United States (we have 32 data
centers globally). To date, about 50% of our applications run a large part of their
processing in the public or private cloud. Approximately 70% of our data is now
running in the public or private cloud. By the end of 2024, we aim to have 70% of
applications and 75% of data moved to the public or private cloud. The new data
centers are around 30% more efficient than our existing legacy data centers. Going
to the public cloud can provide 30% additional efficiency if done correctly (efficiency
improves when your data and applications have been modified, or “refactored,” to
enable new cloud services). We have been constantly updating most of our global
data centers, and by the end of this year, we can start closing some that are larger,
older and less efficient.

ACQUIRING FIRST REPUBLIC BANK AND ITS CUSTOMERS

The purchase of First Republic Bank was not something that we would have done just
for ourselves. But the regulators relied on us to step forward (we worked hand in
hand with the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and
the U.S. Treasury), and the purchase of First Republic helped stabilize and strengthen
the U.S. financial system in a time of crisis.

The acquisition of a major company entails a lot of complexity. People tend to focus
on the financial and economic outcomes, which is a reasonable thing to do. And in
the case of First Republic, the numbers look rather good. We recorded an
accounting gain of $3 billion on the purchase, and we told the world we expected to
add more than $500 million to earnings annually, which we now believe will be closer
to $2 billion. However, these results mask some of the true costs. First, approximately
one-third of the incremental earning was simply deploying excess capital and
liquidity, which doesn’t require purchasing a $300 billion bank — we simply could
have bought $300 billion of assets. Second, as soon as the deal was announced,
approximately 7,600 of our employees went from working on tasks that would

benefit the future of JPMorgan Chase to working on the merger integration. Overall,
the integration involves effectively combining more than 165 systems (e.g.,
statement, deposit, accounting and human resources) and consolidating policies, risk
reporting, and other various rules and procedures. We hope to have most of the
integration done by the middle of 2024.

Fortunately, we were very familiar and comfortable with all of the assets we were
acquiring from First Republic. What we didn’t take on was First Republic’s excessive
interest rate exposure — one of the reasons it failed — which we effectively hedged
within days of the acquisition.

Our people did a great job of respectfully managing this transition, knowing that
circumstances were particularly tough for our new colleagues, whom we tried to
welcome with open arms. We did everything we could to redeploy individuals whose
jobs were lost because of the merger (we directly hired over 5,000 people). Our
approach has always been to go into an acquisition knowing we can learn things
from other teams, and in this case, we did: First Republic had done an outstanding
job serving high-net-worth clients and venture capitalists, and we are developing
what is effectively a new business for us following First Republic’s servicing model.
We will serve these high-net-worth clients through a single point of contact,
supported by a concierge service model, across our distribution channels —
including more than 20 new JPMorgan Chase branded branches.

NAVIGATING IN A COMPLEX AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS WORLD

In the policy section, we talk about how we may be entering one of the most
treacherous geopolitical eras since World War II. And I have written in the past about
high levels of debt, fiscal stimulus, ongoing deficit spending and the unknown effects
of quantitative tightening (which I am more worried about than most) so I won’t
repeat those views here. However, the impacts of these geopolitical and economic
forces are large and somewhat unprecedented; they may not be fully understood
until they have completely played out over multiple years. In any case, JPMorgan
Chase must be prepared for the various potential impacts and outcomes on our
company and our people.

We remain wary of economic prognosticating.

While all companies essentially budget on a base case forecast, we are very careful
not to run our business that way. Instead, we look at a range of potential outcomes
for which we need to be prepared. Geopolitical and economic forces have an
unpredictable timetable — they may unfold over months, or years, and are nearly
impossible to put into a one-year forecast. They also have an unpredictable interplay:
For example, the geopolitical situation may end up having virtually no effect on the
world’s economy or it could potentially be its determinative factor.

We have ongoing concerns about persistent inflationary pressures and consider
a wide range of outcomes to manage interest rate exposure and other business
risks.

Many key economic indicators today continue to be good and possibly improving,
including inflation. But when looking ahead to tomorrow, conditions that will affect
the future should be considered. For example, there seems to be a large number of
persistent inflationary pressures, which may likely continue. All of the following
factors appear to be inflationary: ongoing fiscal spending, remilitarization of the
world, restructuring of global trade, capital needs of the new green economy, and
possibly higher energy costs in the future (even though there currently is an
oversupply of gas and plentiful spare capacity in oil) due to a lack of needed
investment in the energy infrastructure. In the past, fiscal deficits did not seem to be
closely related to inflation. In the 1970s and early 1980s, there was a general
understanding that inflation was driven by “guns and butter”; i.e., fiscal deficits and
the increase to the money supply, both partially driven by the Vietnam War, led to
increased inflation, which went over 10%. The deficits today are even larger and
occurring in boom times — not as the result of a recession — and they have been
supported by quantitative easing, which was never done before the great financial
crisis. Quantitative easing is a form of increasing the money supply (though it has
many offsets). I remain more concerned about quantitative easing than most, and its
reversal, which has never been done before at this scale.

Equity values, by most measures, are at the high end of the valuation range, and
credit spreads are extremely tight. These markets seem to be pricing in at a 70% to
80% chance of a soft landing — modest growth along with declining inflation and
interest rates. I believe the odds are a lot lower than that. In the meantime, there
seems to be an enormous focus, too much so, on monthly inflation data and modest
changes to interest rates. But the die may be cast — interest rates looking out a year
or two may be predetermined by all of the factors I mentioned above. Small changes
in interest rates today may have less impact on inflation in the future than many
people believe.

Therefore, we are prepared for a very broad range of interest rates, from 2% to 8% or
even more, with equally wide-ranging economic outcomes — from strong economic
growth with moderate inflation (in this case, higher interest rates would result from
higher demand for capital) to a recession with inflation; i.e., stagflation. Economically,
the worst-case scenario would be stagflation, which would not only come with higher
interest rates but also with higher credit losses, lower business volumes and more
difficult markets. Under these many different scenarios, our company would continue
to perform at least okay. Importantly, being prepared means we can continue to help
our clients no matter what the future portends.

The mini banking crisis of 2023 is over, but beware of higher rates and
recession — not just for banks but for the whole economy.

When we purchased First Republic in May 2023 following the failure of two other
regional banks, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, we thought that
the current banking crisis was over. Only these three banks were offsides in having
the toxic combination of extreme interest rate exposure, large unrealized losses in
the held-to-maturity (HTM) portfolio and highly concentrated deposits. Most of the
other regional banks did not have these problems. However, we stipulated that the
crisis was over provided that interest rates didn’t go up dramatically and we didn’t
experience a serious recession. If long-end rates go up over 6% and this increase is
accompanied by a recession, there will be plenty of stress — not just in the banking
system but with leveraged companies and others. Remember, a simple 2 percentage
point increase in rates essentially reduced the value of most financial assets by 20%,
and certain real estate assets, specifically office real estate, may be worth even less
due to the effects of recession and higher vacancies. Also remember that credit
spreads tend to widen, sometimes dramatically, in a recession.

Finally, we should also consider that rates have been extremely low for a long time —
it’s hard to know how many investors and companies are truly prepared for a higher
rate environment.

We seek to be engaged globally and carefully manage complex countries and
geopolitical issues.

JPMorgan Chase does business in more than 100 countries, and we have people on
the ground in over 60 countries. In almost all those locations, we do research on their
economy, their markets and their companies; we bank their government institutions
and their companies; and we bank multinational corporations, including the U.S.
multinational corporations within their borders. This is a critical role — not only in
helping those countries grow and improve but also in expanding the global
economy.

Many of these countries are quite complex with different laws, customs and
regulations. We are occasionally asked why we bank certain companies and even
certain countries, particularly when countries have some laws and customs that are
counter to many of the values held in the United States. Here’s why:

   •   The U.S. government sets foreign policy. And when it does, we salute.
       Wherever we do business, we follow the law of the United States, as it applies
       in that country (in addition to the laws of the country itself), in all respects.
       Think of trade rules, sanctions, anti-money laundering and the Foreign
       Corrupt Practices Act, among others. By and large, these things help improve
       those countries. In most cases, the U.S. government does not want us to leave

       because it agrees, generally, that the engagement of American business
       enhances our relationships with other countries and helps those countries
       themselves.
   •   Engagement makes the world a better place. We all should want the world
       to continue to improve. Isolation and lack of engagement do not accomplish
       that goal. While we believe that it makes sense for the United States to push
       for constant improvement around the world — from advocating for human
       rights to fighting corruption — this is rarely accomplished through coercion,
       and, in fact, is enhanced by engagement.
   •   We need to be prepared for emerging challenges and position ourselves
       to understand them. We created a new role — Head of Asia Pacific Policy
       and Strategic Competitiveness — to focus specifically on key policy issues
       critical to the firm’s (and, in fact, the country’s) competitiveness, such as trade
       restrictions, supply chains and infrastructure. We also created a new strategic
       security forum to focus on emerging and evolving risks, including trade wars,
       pandemics, cybersecurity and actual wars, to name just a few.
OUR EXTENSIVE COMMUNITY OUTREACH EFFORTS, INCLUDING
DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION

JPMorgan Chase makes an extraordinary effort as part of our “normal” day-to-day
outreach to engage with individual clients, small and midsized businesses, large and
multinational firms, government officials, regulators and the press in cities all around
the world. This dialogue is part of the normal course of business but it is also part of
building trust and putting down roots in a community.

We believe that companies, and banks in particular, must earn the trust of the
communities and countries in which they operate. We believe — and we are
unashamed about this — that it is our obligation to help lift up the communities and
countries in which we do business. We believe that doing so enhances business and
the general economic well-being of those communities and countries and also
enhances long-term shareholder value. JPMorgan Chase thrives when communities
thrive.

This approach is integral to what we do, in great scale, around the world — and it
works. We are quite clear that whether our efforts are inspired by the goodness of
our hearts (as philanthropy or venture-type investing) or good business, we try to
measure the actual outcomes.

It’s also interesting to point out that many of our efforts were spawned from our
work around Advancing Black Pathways, Military and Veterans Affairs, and our work
in Detroit. While we’ve banked Detroit for more than 90 years, our $200 million
investment in its economic recovery over the last decade demonstrated that
investing in communities is a smart business strategy. We are one of the largest

banks in Detroit, from consumer banking to investment banking, and it’s quite clear
that not only did our efforts help Detroit, but they also helped us gain market share.
The extent of Detroit’s remarkable recovery was recently highlighted when Moody’s
upgraded the city’s credit rating to investment grade — an extraordinary
achievement just over 10 years after the city filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in
U.S. history.

For JPMorgan Chase, Detroit was an incubator for developing models that help us
hone how we deploy our business resources, philanthropic capital, skilled
volunteerism, and low-cost loans and equity investments, as well as how we identify
top talent to drive successful business and societal improvements. I hope that, as
shareholders, you are proud of our focus on promoting opportunity for all, both
within and outside our organization, which includes economic opportunity. Some of
our initiatives are listed below.

   •   Business Resource Groups. To deepen our culture of inclusion in the
       workplace, we have 10 Business Resource Groups (BRG) across the company
       to connect more than 160,000 participating employees around common
       interests, as well as to foster networking and camaraderie. Groups welcome
       anyone — allies and those with shared affinities alike. For example, some of
       our largest BRGs are Access Ability (employees with disabilities and
       caregivers), Adelante (Hispanic and Latino employees), BOLD (Black
       employees), NextGen (early career professionals), PRIDE (LGBTQ+ employees)
       and Women on the Move.
   •   Women on the Move. At JPMorgan Chase, they sure are! Women represent
       28% of our firm’s senior leadership globally. In fact, our major lines of business
       — CCB, AWM and CIB, which would be among Fortune 1000 companies on
       their own — are all run by women (one with a co-head who is male). More
       than 10 years ago, a handful of senior women at the company, on their own,
       started this global, firmwide, internally focused organization called Women on
       the Move. It was so successful that we expanded the initiative beyond the
       company; it now empowers clients and consumers, as well as women
       employees and their allies, to build their careers, grow their businesses and
       improve their financial health. The Women on the Move BRG has more than
       70,000 employees globally.
   •   Advancing Black Pathways. This comprehensive program, which just reached
       the five-year mark, focuses on strengthening the economic foundation of
       Black communities because we know that opportunity is not always created
       equally. The program does so by, among other accomplishments, helping to
       diversify our talent pipeline, providing opportunities for Black individuals to
       enter the workforce and gain valuable experience, and investing in the
       financial success of Black Americans through a focus on financial health,
       homeownership and entrepreneurship. An important part of the program’s

    work is achieved through our investment in Historically Black Colleges and
    Universities (HBCU). We now partner with 18 schools across the United States
    to boost recruitment connections, expand career pathways for Black students
    and other students, and support their long-term development and financial
    health. As a measure of the program’s success, in four years we have made
    nearly 400 hires into summer and full-time analyst and associate roles at the
    firm.
•   Military and Veterans Affairs. This firmwide effort sponsors recruitment,
    mentorship and development programs to support the military members and
    veterans working at JPMorgan Chase. Back in 2011, we joined with 10 other
    companies to launch the Veteran Jobs Mission (VJM), whose membership has
    since grown to more than 300 companies representing various industries
    across the United States and has hired over 900,000 veterans and military
    spouses. In 2023, VJM announced the creation of its Advisory Board, which is
    composed of 14 corporate leaders, to provide strategic direction and
    oversight of VJM as it continues to expand its commitment to support
    economic opportunities for veterans and military spouses, including its goal to
    hire 2 million veterans and 200,000 military spouses by 2030. JPMorgan Chase
    alone has hired in excess of 18,000 veterans since 2011 and currently
    employs more than 3,100 military spouses.
•   Creating opportunity for people with disabilities. The firm’s Office of
    Disability Inclusion continues to lead strategy and initiatives aimed at
    advancing economic opportunity for people with disabilities. In 2023, we
    joined lawmakers and business leaders in Washington, D.C., to show support
    for passage of the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Savings Penalty
    Elimination Act. Modernizing the SSI program, by updating asset limits for the
    first time in nearly 40 years, would allow millions of people with disabilities
    who receive SSI benefits the opportunity to build their savings without putting
    their essential benefits at risk. We also provided business coaching to more
    than 370 entrepreneurs with disabilities.
•   Virtual call centers. When we sought to expand our customer service
    specialists program across the United States, we turned to Detroit, launching
    our first virtual call center in 2022. Investments in Detroit’s workforce
    development infrastructure helped us hire 90 virtual customer service
    specialists for a program that has outperformed many of our traditional call
    centers around the world. Following this success, we expanded our hiring
    efforts and this virtual program to Baltimore to create new jobs that jump-
    start careers. And now we’re evaluating the possibility of expanding even
    further.
•   Entrepreneurs of Color Fund. A critical challenge we have seen in so many
    communities is that traditional lending standards render too many
    entrepreneurs — particularly entrepreneurs of color and those serving these
    communities — ineligible for credit. In response, we helped launch the

    Entrepreneurs of Color Fund (EOCF) in Detroit, a lending program designed to
    help aspiring small business owners gain access to critical resources needed
    for growth that are often not equitably available — capital, technical
    assistance and mentorship, among others. These challenges aren’t unique to
    Detroit so we worked with community development financial institutions to
    replicate the EOCF program in 10 markets across the United States in 2023,
    deploying more than 2,900 loans and $176 million in capital to underserved
    entrepreneurs across the country.
•   Senior business consultants. To help entrepreneurs and small businesses
    make the transition from community lending to accessing capital from
    traditional financial institutions, we created a new job — senior business
    consultant — to provide support. Senior business consultants in branches that
    focus on underserved communities offer coaching and help business owners
    with everything from navigating access to credit to managing cash flow to
    generating effective marketing. Since 2020, these consultants have mentored
    more than 5,500 business owners, helping them improve their operations,
    grow revenue and network with others in the local business community.
•   AdvancingCities. The organizing principles that define the business and
    community investments we make and how we best achieve an overall impact
    in local economies were heavily influenced by our experience in Detroit.
    Seeing Detroit’s comeback begin to take shape several years ago, we
    created AdvancingCities to replicate this model for large-scale investments
    to other cities around the world. From San Francisco to Paris to Greater
    Washington, D.C., we’ve applied what we learned in Detroit to communities
    where conditions are opportune for success and require deeper investments
    — where community, civic and business leaders have come together to solve
    problems and get results.
•   JPMorgan Chase Service Corps. Ten years ago, we launched the JPMorgan
    Chase Service Corps to strengthen the capacity-building of nonprofit partners.
    We brought employees from around the world to Detroit to assist with its
    recovery — from creating a scoring model for a nonprofit to helping prioritize
    neighborhoods for development funding to devising an implementation plan
    for an integrated talent management system. Since that time, the Service
    Corps has expanded, with more than 1,500 JPMorgan Chase employees
    contributing 100,000 hours to support over 300 nonprofits globally.
•   Community Centers/Branches and Community Managers. A local bank
    branch, especially in a low-income neighborhood, can be successful only when
    it fits the community’s needs. That is why over the last several years we have
    shifted our approach to how we offer access to financial health education, as
    well as low-cost products and services to help build wealth. Since 2019, we
    have opened 16 Community Center branches, often in areas with larger Black,
    Hispanic or Latino populations, and have plans to open three more by the end
    of 2024. These branches have more space to host grassroots community

       events, small business mentoring sessions and financial health seminars, which
       have been well-attended — to date, over 400,000 people have taken
       advantage of the financial education seminars. In each of these Community
       Center branches, we hired a Community Manager (who acts as a local
       ambassador) to build relationships with community leaders, nonprofits and
       small businesses. The Community Manager concept and practice have
       become so successful that we have also placed these managers in many of our
       traditional branches in underserved communities. We now have 149
       Community Managers throughout our branch network.
   •   Work skills development. Detroit showed us how talent in communities is
       often overlooked. We saw this in the early days of our investment when we
       visited our partners at Focus: HOPE, a training program designed to help
       Detroiters develop skills for high-demand jobs. Quickly, it became clear that
       the training and education system in Detroit was disconnected from
       employers and their talent needs. By investing in programs like Focus: HOPE,
       we have been able to help bridge local skills gaps by training people for in-
       demand jobs in communities like Dallas, Miami and Washington, D.C. Between
       2019 and 2023, we supported more than 2 million people through our
       extensive learning and career programming around the world.
   •   Increasing our rural investment. We are proud to be the only bank with
       branches in all 48 contiguous states, which include many rural communities.
       Nearly 17 million consumers living in rural areas hold over $100 billion in
       deposits with us and $175 billion in loans. We are also a leading wholesale
       lender in these communities, helping to fuel local economies through
       relationships with local companies, governments, hospitals and universities.
       Since 2019, we have made material progress in extending our footprint to
       reach more rural Americans, including expanding our branch network into 13
       new states with large rural populations. Now we are raising the bar. With our
       new strategy, we have a goal to have a branch available to serve 50% of a
       state’s population within an acceptable driving distance, including in heavily
       rural states such as Alabama and Iowa. This focus is part of our recently
       announced plan to build an additional 500 branches and hire 3,500 employees
       over the next three years. Through this expansion, we will partner across lines
       of business and our Corporate Responsibility organization to help advance
       inclusive economic growth and bring the full force of the firm to America’s
       heartland.

We’ve nearly completed our five-year, $30 billion Racial Equity Commitment —
it will now become a permanent part of our business.

What began in 2020 as a five-year, $30 billion commitment is now transforming into
a consistent business practice for our lines of business in support of Black, Hispanic,
Latino and other underserved communities. By the end of 2023, we reported over

$30 billion in progress toward our original goal. However, our focus is not on how
much money is deployed — but on long-term impact and outcomes. And going
forward, these programs will be embedded in our business-as-usual operating
system.

   •   Affordable rental housing. Through our Affordable Housing Preservation
       program, we approved program funding to date of approximately $21 billion
       in loans to incentivize the preservation of over 190,000 affordable housing
       rental units across the United States. Additionally, we financed approximately
       $5 billion for the construction and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing.
   •   Homeownership. In 2023, we expanded our $5,000 Chase Homebuyer Grant
       program to include over 15,000 majority Black, Hispanic and Latino
       communities — and in January 2024, we increased our grant amount to
       $7,500 in select markets. Since our grant program began in 2021, we have
       provided about 8,600 grants totaling $43 million. We also have provided
       home purchase and refinance loans in 2023 worth over $4.6 billion for more
       than 14,000 Black, Hispanic and Latino households across the economic
       spectrum.
   •   Small business. The Business Card Special Purpose Credit Program, launched
       in January 2023, has provided over 10,900 cards, totaling over $43 million in
       available credit lines to underserved entrepreneurs and communities across
       the United States.
   •   Supplier diversity. In 2023, our firm spent approximately $2.3 billion directly
       with diverse suppliers — an increase of 10% over 2022. As a part of our racial
       equity commitment, over $450 million was spent in 2023 with more than 190
       Black-, Hispanic- and Latino-owned businesses.
   •   Minority depository institutions and community development financial
       institutions. To date, we have invested more than $110 million in equity in
       diverse financial institutions and provided over $260 million in incremental
       financing to community development financial institutions to support
       communities that lack access to traditional financing. JPMorgan Chase also
       helped these institutions build their capacity so they can provide a greater
       number of critical services like mortgages and small business loans.

We’re thoughtfully continuing our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.

Of course, JPMorgan Chase will conform as the laws evolve. We will scour our
programs, our words and our actions to make sure they comply.

That said, we think all the efforts mentioned above will remain largely unchanged.
And, in fact, around the world, cities and communities where we do business applaud
these efforts. We also believe our initiatives make us a more inclusive company and
lead to more innovation, smarter decisions and better financial results for us and for
the economy overall.

We are often asked in particular about “equity” and what that word means. To us, it
means equal treatment, equal opportunity and equal access … not equal outcomes.
There is nothing wrong with acknowledging and trying to bridge social and
economic gaps, whether they be around wealth or health. We would like to provide a
fair chance for everyone to succeed — regardless of their background. And we want
to make sure everyone who works at our company feels welcome.

We want to articulate how we weigh in on social issues and what it means for
our customers.

Before I comment about culture issues, I have a confession to make: I am a full-
throated, red-blooded, patriotic, free-enterprise (properly regulated, of course) and
free-market capitalist. Our company is frequently asked to take a position on an
issue, rule or legislation that might be considered “cultural.” When that happens, we
take a deep breath and study the matter. Many of the laws in question have many
specific requirements, some of which you would agree with but not others. But we
are being asked to support the entire law. In cases like these, we simply make our
own statement that reflects our educated view and values; however, we do not give
our voice to others.

We believe in the values of democracy, including freedom of speech and expression,
and are staunchly against discrimination and hate. We have not turned away — and
will not turn away — customers because of their political or religious affiliations nor
would we tell customers how they should spend their money.

Our commitment to these ideals is also reflected in our employees. The talent at our
firm is a vibrant mix of cultures, beliefs and backgrounds. We are, of course, fully
committed to freedom of speech. There are things that you can say that would be
permitted under freedom of speech but would not be allowed under our Code of
Conduct. For example, we do not allow intimidation, threats or highly prejudicial
behavior or speech. Our Code of Conduct clearly stipulates that certain statements
and behavior, while allowed under freedom of speech, can lead to disciplinary action
at our company — from being reprimanded to being fired.
WHAT WE LEARNED: A FIVE-POINT ACTION PLAN TO MOVE FORWARD ON
THE CLIMATE CHALLENGE

In May 2023, we gathered with knowledgeable and influential people from the
energy industry writ large to the government and financial services arena in
Scottsdale, Arizona, for an action forum. The goal was to explore various aspects of
the climate challenge and try to devise effective solutions that could help lead to
meaningful progress. The climate challenge is immense and complex. Addressing it
requires more than making simplistic statements and rules; rather, energy systems
and global supply chains need to be transformed across virtually all industries. And

there is also a deep need for new research and development. Energy systems and
supply chains provide the foundation of the global economy and must be treated
with care.

At the same time, the opportunity here is immense. The investment required to meet
climate goals — estimated at over $5 trillion annually — could generate
economywide growth and opportunity at a scale the world has not seen since the
Industrial Revolution.

The task for industry, policymakers and finance is to help formulate solutions that
support the transition to a low-carbon economy, balancing affordable, reliable access
to energy with generating economic growth.

To find a way forward, we sought input from diverse stakeholders in pursuit of a
North Star. In Scottsdale and in discussions with clients across industries about
what’s needed to achieve a low-carbon economy, these five action steps and reforms
were top of mind:

   •   Supportive government policy and leadership to advance the
       transition. Policy that promotes favorable economic conditions to make the
       transition viable is a critical first step for clients. This includes government
       leadership via mandates, incentives or subsidies to support jobs and
       investment in the transition; actions on permitting and interconnection
       reform; and regulatory clarity and certainty, especially around long-term
       investments. As one vital example, current grid infrastructure is insufficient to
       accommodate the growth in renewables.
   •   Public/private partnerships in scaling bankable projects. Scaling
       investments needs to happen both for commercially proven technologies (e.g.,
       wind and solar) and for emerging technologies (e.g., green hydrogen,
       sustainable aviation fuel and carbon capture). Developing “bankable” clean
       energy projects will require the application of smart financial tools, as well as
       further policy support. It will take public/private partnerships and innovation
       to create catalytic forms of capital that can step into these gaps, absorb first-
       mover risks and provide the necessary funding. The cost of capital is too high
       for some companies — and public funds ought to be deployed in a smart way
       that effectively attracts private capital.
   •   Public education and engagement. Without question, clients told us that
       public commitment to and investment in energy-related infrastructure is one
       of the most important parts of combating the climate crisis and running their
       businesses. Supporting the buildout of energy-related infrastructure with
       speed and scale is critical. Public acceptance of building and advancing the
       infrastructure needed to meet climate goals is at the heart of progress. While
       the energy transition is poised to deliver benefits to communities across the
       world, securing acceptance and support to build clean energy infrastructure at

       scale is challenging. Access to job-creating renewable energy projects can
       help rural communities thrive by advancing local economies. Ensuring public
       support and social license to operate requires better engagement strategies,
       including widespread stakeholder education about the benefits of these
       technologies for local communities.
   •   Communication about concrete successes. Across industries, market
       participants need to do a better job of celebrating and championing concrete
       successes and tangible milestones. This includes highlighting success stories
       around emerging technologies and the complex nature of the carbon
       transition. Stakeholders also should better convey the benefits of clean energy
       — across all technologies — to help combat misinformation and foster a more
       informed dialogue.
   •   Work skills training. Businesses depend on healthy, thriving communities so
       the carbon transition needs to work for everyone. This includes helping to
       ensure that workers are trained in the skills for the future, such as through
       improved engineering schools and job training programs. Work across the
       entire supply chain is essential to moving at pace. As one example, the U.S.
       Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates we will need more than 70,000 additional
       electricians per year through 2031; it is currently unclear how the market will
       meet that demand. If the deployment of heat pumps and electric vehicle
       chargers accelerates, demand for electricians will be even higher. A concerted
       focus to train electricians can help the United States meet some of its climate
       goals while providing well-paying jobs that do not require a four-year college
       degree. Also, broadly speaking, businesses are in a better position to make
       investments with confidence when labor requirements across the value chain
       — from design and manufacturing to installation — are satisfied.

We recently reconsidered certain memberships.

JPMorgan Chase recently exited Climate Action 100+ and the Equator Principles.
“Why?” we are asked. While we don’t necessarily disagree with some of the principles
many organizations have, we make our own business decisions. We think we have
some of the best-in-class environmental, social and risk standards because we have
invested in our own in-house experts and matured our own risk management
processes over the years. As a result, we are going to go our own way and make our
own independent decisions, gathering the best learnings of experts in the field, and,
of course, we will follow all legal requirements.

We are engaged but recognize our role: three more important points.

First, everyone should understand that conquering the climate problem needs proper
government action, particularly around taxes, permitting, grids, infrastructure
building and proper coordination of policies — we are not there yet. Second, there is
no known technology that can fill the gap between our “aspirations” and the current

trajectory of the world. We hope and believe that this will be found (for example,
through carbon capture, improved batteries, hydrogen or other measures). This new
technology will also require proper government research and development funding,
as the effort cannot be accomplished by private enterprise alone. And third, we are
going to use the word “commitment” much more reservedly in the future, clearly
differentiating between aspirations we are actively striving toward and binding
commitments.

For JPMorgan Chase to play the right role in tackling the climate challenge, we have
organized a special group around the green economy and related infrastructure
investment. This group will coordinate and inform our work across all established
industry groups (from auto to real estate, energy, agriculture and others) and
includes hundreds of employees devoted to these efforts.
POWERING ECONOMIC GROWTH IN FLORIDA

From Tallahassee to Miami and from Tampa to Palm Bay, JPMorgan Chase has been
committed to Florida for more than 130 years and has enjoyed being the bank for all
communities. Each year, we contribute billions of dollars to the economy, hire and
train local residents, help to revitalize neighborhoods and remove barriers to
opportunity for Floridians across the state. Our partnerships with businesses,
nonprofits, government entities and community organizations have enabled us to
drive sustainable impact and help them achieve their goals. We couldn’t be more
proud to help make opportunity happen in Florida.

This year, we forged a relationship with Inter Miami CF, one of the most recognizable
sports teams in the world. Through this partnership and the newly named Chase
Stadium, we’re continuing to contribute to South Florida and its local communities.
In Tampa, home to nearly 6,000 of our employees, we’re triggering an additional
$210 million in economic activity and creating over 660 local construction jobs
through the renovation of our Highland Oaks campus and downtown Tampa office.
We’re proud that one-third of all Floridians do business with us through deposits,
credit cards or a mortgage. Through each of our investments across the state, we’re
ensuring that residents have the resources and tools they need to thrive.

Our support to government, higher education, healthcare and nonprofit
organizations:

   •   We serve over 150 government, higher education, healthcare and nonprofit

       helping them play an essential role in maintaining the state’s economy and
       serve local communities.

Our support to small business:

   •   At the end of 2023, balances for loans extended to Florida’s small businesses
       totaled more than $1.2 billion — funds being used to help those businesses
       scale and grow, contribute to the economy and create local jobs.
   •   Across the state, we have over 654,000 small business customers.
   •   In 2023, our bankers and senior business consultants spent more than 375,000
       hours advising and supporting Florida business owners.

Our support to consumer banking needs:

   •   We operate 1,445 ATMs and 410 branches across the state.
   •   In 2023, we supported more than 6.1 million customers with mortgages, auto
       loans and savings, checking and credit card accounts, giving JPMorgan Chase
       one of the largest consumer banking market shares in the state.
   •   We managed more than $70 billion in investment and annuity assets for local
       clients.

Our business and community investments:

   •   Over the last five years, we have committed nearly $65 million in philanthropic
       support, including:

          o   $3 million to The Miami Foundation’s Resilient 305: Building Prosperity
              Collaborative to increase access to quality jobs and develop small
              businesses through training, investments and capacity-building.
           o $1.6 million to the Community Justice Project, which empowers
              community-based legal advocates to help delay displacement and
              improve conditions for housing stability for renters across nine Florida
              counties.
   •   In 2022, we committed $10 million over five years to Tech Equity Miami to
       advance equal access to tech skills, careers and education, including:
           o A $1 million investment to Florida Memorial University, South Florida’s
              only HBCU, to help traditionally underresourced students pursue a
              career in technology.

Our support as a local employer:

   •   We employ more than 14,000 residents throughout the state, including nearly
       1,900 veterans and over 660 people with a criminal background who deserve a
       second chance.
   •   In Florida, the average salary of our employees is more than $87,000 (plus a
       starting comprehensive annual benefits package worth nearly $17,600)
       compared with the statewide per capita income of nearly $40,300.
GIVING THE BANK REGULATORY AND SUPERVISORY PROCESS A SERIOUS
REVIEW

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) was
finished 14 years ago, and we believe it accomplished a lot of good things. But it’s
been quite a while since then, and we’re still debating some very basic issues. It’s
time to take a serious, hard, honest look at what has been done and what can be
improved.

It’s good to remember that the United States has the best financial system in the
world, with diversified, deep and experienced institutions, from banks, pension plans,
hedge funds and private equity to individual investors. It has healthy public and
private markets, transparency, rule of law and deep research. The best banking
system in the world is a critical part of this, and, integrated with the overall financial
system, is foundational to the proper allocation of capital, innovation and the fueling
of America’s growth engine.

This is not about JPMorgan Chase — we believe we can manage through whatever is
thrown our way. This is about the impact on all parts of the system — from smaller
banks to larger regional banks that may not have the resources to handle all of these
regulatory requirements. It’s also about the effect on the financial markets and the
economy from the rapidly growing shadow banking system, as well as the ultimate

impact on the customers, clients and communities we serve. This is about what’s
right for the system.

The banking and financial system is innovative, dynamic and constantly
changing.

The banking system is not static: There are startup banks, mergers, successful
upstarts and fintech banks, and even Apple, which effectively acts as a bank — it
holds money, moves money, lends money and so on. Nonbanks are competing with
traditional banks, and, in general, this dynamism and churn are good for innovation
and invention — with success and failure simply part of the robust process.
Innovation runs across payments systems, budgeting, digital access, product
extensions, risk and fraud prevention, and other services. Different institutions play
different roles, and, importantly, small banks and big banks serve completely
different strategic functions. Large banks bank multinational corporations around the
world, make healthy markets, and wield technology and a product set that are the
best in the world. A small bank simply cannot bank these same multinational
governments and safely move the amount of money and securities that large banks
do. Regional and community banks have exceptional local knowledge and presence
and are critical in serving thousands of towns and certain geographies.

It is also important to recognize that the banking system as we know it is shrinking
relative to private markets and fintech, which are growing and becoming increasingly
competitive. And remember that many of these new players do not have the same
transparency or need to abide by the extensive rules and regulations as traditional
banks, even if they offer similar products — this often gives them significant
advantage.

To deal with this fluid environment, banks of all sizes develop their own strategies,
whether to specialize, expand geographically or embark on mergers and acquisitions.
There are certain banking services where economies of scale are a competitive
advantage, but not all banks need to become bigger to gain this benefit (there are
many highly successful banks that are smaller). What is clear is that banks should be
allowed to pursue their individual strategies, including mergers and acquisitions, as
they see fit. Overall, this process should be allowed to happen — it’s part of the
natural and healthy course of capitalism — and it can be done without harming the
American taxpayer or economy.

While we all want a strong banking and financial system, we should step back and
assess how all the regulatory steps we have taken measure up against the goals we
all share. Since Dodd-Frank was signed into law in 2010, thousands of rules and
reporting requirements written by 10+ different regulatory bodies in the United
States alone have been added. And it would probably be an understatement to say
that some are duplicative, inconsistent, procyclical, contradictory, extremely costly,

and unnecessarily painful for both banks and regulators. Many of the rules have
unintended consequences that are not desirable and have negative impacts, such as
increasing the cost of credit for consumers (hurting lower-income Americans the
most).

The whole process, including the Basel III endgame, could be much more
productive, streamlined, economical, efficient and safe.

Both regulators and banks should want the same thing — a healthy banking system,
serving its clients and striving for continuous improvement. We all should also want
the enormous benefits that would come from good collaboration between regulators
and bank management teams and boards.

Over time, these relationships have deteriorated, and, again, are increasingly less
constructive. There is little real collaboration between practitioners — the banks —
and regulators, who generally have not been practitioners in business. While we
acknowledge the dedication of regulators who work with banks on a daily basis,
management teams across the industry are putting in a disproportionate amount of
time addressing requests for extra details, documentation and processes that extend
far beyond the actual rules — and distract both regulators and management from
more critical work. We should be more focused on the truly important risks for the
safety of the system. And unfortunately, without collaboration and sufficient analysis,
it is hard to be confident that regulation will accomplish desired outcomes without
undesirable consequences. Instead of constantly improving the system, we may be
making it worse. A few additional points:

   •   The Basel III endgame disadvantages American banks. The Basel III
       endgame has been 10 years in the making, and it still has not been
       completed. In my view, many of the rules are flawed and poorly calibrated. If
       the Basel III endgame were implemented in its current form, it would hamper
       American banks: As proposed, it would increase our firm’s required capital by
       25%, making our requirement 30% higher than it would be under the
       equivalent European Union proposal. That means for every loan and asset
       financed in the United States by a major American bank, that bank would have
       to hold 30% more capital than any international competitor. The proposed
       regulations would also damage market making (see the following section).
       There are many other flaws but suffice it to say that much of the work being
       done today to analyze the effects should have been done before the
       proposed rulemaking.

       One of the single most important lessons from the great financial crisis is that
       there is enormous value to having a bank that is well-managed and has
       diverse revenue sources. Yet regulation since then both punishes

       consolidation and diversification — and punishes performance — through
       many features of the GSIB surcharge.
   •   Built over many years, the framework is now full of duplication. The
       following is only a partial list: American gold-plating and conceptual
       inconsistencies among Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR),
       recovery and resolution plans, liquidity requirements, global systemically
       important bank (GSIB) requirements, and safety and soundness principles. The
       many overlapping rules contribute to the bureaucracy that generates an
       extraordinary amount of make-work (an 80,000-page CCAR and shockingly
       another, coincidentally, 80,000-page recovery and resolution plan).
   •   The new rules do virtually nothing to fix what caused the failure of SVB
       and First Republic. For example, they don’t improve certain liquidity
       requirements, limit HTM accounting or reduce allowable interest rate
       exposure.
   •   The current regulatory approach to liquidity might simply run counter to
       the stated intent. Regulations should recognize the value and importance of
       lending and borrowing against good collateral and using central bank
       resources, such as the discount window. Adhering to current liquidity
       requirements permanently ties up good liquidity in a way that makes the
       system more fragile and more risky.
   •   It is not clear what the full intent of the Basel III endgame was – it will
       have unintended consequences. Without real analysis of expected
       outcomes, additional regulation will likely reduce the number of banks
       offering certain services and increase costs for all market participants and
       activity, including loans, market making and hedging (by farmers, airlines and
       countries, among others). And new rules might even increase consolidation as
       companies race to achieve economies of scale in certain products and
       services.

Unfortunately, some recent regulations are ending up in court. You can imagine that
no one wants to sue their regulators. Banks would not sue if they did not think they
were right — or if they thought they had any other recourse — which they effectively
do not. This is definitely not what anyone should want. A more constructive
relationship with regulators would reduce confusion and uncertainty and would lead
to better outcomes for banks, their shareholders, and their clients, customers and
communities.

Collaboration between banks and regulators could improve the use of
resources and create better outcomes.

True collaboration could dramatically improve the banking system. For example:

   •   Redirect enormous resources from things that don’t matter to things that
       do. As mentioned, it takes 80,000 pages to describe a CCAR test and 80,000

       pages to detail recovery and resolution. The talent and resources at the banks
       and regulators could be better used elsewhere. Such overload is distracting
       and takes your eye off the ball on real, emerging risks, including China, trade,
       payment systems and cybersecurity, among others.
   •   Reduce bureaucratic processes that provoke a tendency to herd
       mentality. For example, CCAR is just a point-in-time stress test, and it can lull
       you into a false sense of security — for reference, we do more than 100 stress
       tests each week. On interest rate exposure, focusing on the documentation of
       details may stop you from thinking about big interest rate exposure.
       Sometimes analyzing “what ifs” and fat tail risks is better than excessive and
       rigid models and documentations.
   •   Examine risks outside the regulatory system that are rarely analyzed and
       largely unaddressed. These risks include data and privacy, as well as
       consumer banking and payment systems, which are growing fast in the
       unregulated market. In addition, there are potential risks from private credit
       markets (which I talk about later in this section).
   •   Let’s imagine what’s possible with real collaboration. Working together,
       we can improve how the FDIC manages failing institutions, how to limit
       contagion and restore confidence to depositors, how liquidity requirements
       can create more flexible funding for banks under stress, how the banking and
       Federal Reserve’s payment system can become more interoperable, how
       clearinghouse risk can be reduced, how stress tests can protect the system
       from a wider variety of outcomes, how costs and therefore consumer costs
       can be reduced (not increased), how anti-money laundering requirements can
       be simplified and improved at the same time, and how financial products can
       be brought to the unbanked.

       We can fix the housing and mortgage markets. For example, mortgage
       regulations around origination, servicing and securitization could be
       simplified, without increasing risk, in a way that would reduce the average
       mortgage by 70 or 80 basis points. The Urban Institute estimates that a
       reduction like this would increase mortgage originations by 1 million per year
       and help lower-income households, in particular, buy their first home, thereby
       starting them on the best way to build household net worth.

       There are many more things that can be improved — and we really should
       start working on them.

We need a detailed review and probably a complete revamp.

I know this might be wishful thinking, but now would be a good time to step back
and have a thorough and candid review of the thousands of new rules passed since
Dodd-Frank. After this review, we should ask what is it that we really want: Do we

want to try to eliminate the possibility of bank runs? Do we want to change and
create liquidity rules that would essentially back most uninsured deposits? Do we
want the mortgage business and leveraged lending business to be inside or outside
the banking system? Do we want products that are inside and outside the banking
system to be regulated the same way? Do we want to reasonably give smaller banks
a leg up in purchasing a failing bank? And while Dodd-Frank did some good things,
shouldn’t we take a look at the huge overlapping jurisdictions of various regulators?
This overlap creates difficulties, not only for banks, but for the regulators, too. Any
and all of this is achievable, and, I believe, could be accomplished with simpler rules
and guidelines and without stifling our critical banking system.

PROTECTING THE ESSENTIAL ROLE OF MARKET MAKING (TRADING)

Before we discuss market making and financial markets, readers should understand
that market making occurs in almost all businesses. There are healthy markets in
farm animals, foreign products, commodities, energy, logistics, healthcare and so on.
Healthy markets increase customer choice and reduce cost. They almost always
involve holding inventory and taking some risk, which is simply a part of the process.
America’s financial markets are the biggest in the world — U.S. public debt and
equity markets total $137 trillion, constituting the biggest “market” in the world, and
are larger than America’s gross domestic product (GDP) of $27 trillion.

Market participants are not “Wall Street.” They are large and small, mainly
sophisticated, global investors (pension plans, mutual funds, governments and
individuals) representing retirees, veterans, individuals, unions, federal workers and
others. They all benefit from our efficient, low-cost and transparent markets.

Some regulators seem to think that market making is a speculative, hedge fund-like
activity — and this thinking is what might be leading them to constantly increase
capital requirements. The proposed capital rules could fundamentally alter market-
making activities that are critical to a thriving economy, particularly in difficult
markets when market making is even more important. The new rules would raise
capital requirements by 50% for major banks — which could undermine market
stability, make banking services costlier and less accessible, and push even more
activity to a less regulated banking system.

Our financial system and markets are the best in the world and benefit ALL
participants; exceptionally good market making in the secondary market makes
our primary markets the best in the world.

We should recognize that the United States has the biggest, deepest and most liquid
capital markets in the world. For these markets to function, it is critical for
transparency and liquidity to be in the secondary market. Market making provides
this, promoting the flow of capital to real economy investments and supporting all

sectors of the economy, including companies, state and local governments,
universities, hospitals, pension plans and overall job creation. Without market making
in the secondary market, it would be extremely difficult for companies to raise capital
through the primary market — equity and debt offerings — which have totaled
approximately $3.6 trillion on average over the past few years. The incredible
strength of these markets enables companies of all sizes to grow and expand
especially during times of volatility and stress. It also enables consumers to access
cheaper credit and governments (local, state and federal) to reduce their borrowing
costs.

It takes enormous resources to properly support the Markets business.

JPMorgan Chase spends $700 million per year in extensive research coverage of
nearly 5,200 companies across 83 countries. This massive effort continuously
educates investors and decision makers around the world and often leads to
improved governance and management. It also critically complements the firm’s
market-making activities and further promotes transparency, enabling investors to
make thoughtful choices around investing in capital markets.

I would also like our shareholders to know that our market making is backed by
approximately $7 billion in support expenses, including over $2 billion in technology
spend alone each year. This investment allows us to maintain global trading systems
and constantly improve upon risk management and efficiency.

JPMorgan Chase deploys approximately $70 billion in capital to maintain our Markets
franchise. This capital supports $500 billion in securities inventory (largely hedged) —
and this inventory allows us to buy and sell $2 trillion (notional) in securities daily for
our clients.

Market making entails risk but is not particularly speculative.

The main objective of market makers is to continuously quote prices and diligently
manage an inventory to transact at those prices, which includes assuming certain
risks to support heavy volumes and orderly trading. Market makers have a moral
obligation to try to make markets in good times and in bad. Part of our brand
promise is to stand ready as the willing buyer and seller. In this, we have never failed.
In addition, in most cases regarding government debt, where we serve as a
government securities dealer, we are legally obligated to make markets. This
constant visibility into prices provided by market makers fosters investor confidence,
keeps fees low and promotes economic growth by attracting more investors.

Many large market participants — for example, hedge funds and high-frequency
traders, among others — have no obligation to make markets. In fact, many of these

market participants often “step out” of the markets and dramatically reduce liquidity
specifically when market conditions are difficult.

Market making is not particularly speculative since market makers generally hedge
their positions, as you will see from some real life examples of the economics and
risks. We earn revenue of approximately $100 million on a typical day. In the average
year, the total is nearly $30 billion. On our $2 trillion in notional daily trading, this
amounts to only one hundredth of a cent charged to the investor for these services
— an extraordinarily low cost compared with any other market in the world.

Now let’s take a look at the actual risk and results versus the hypothetical risk and
results. The hypothetical global market shock of the CCAR stress test has us losing
$18 billion in a single day and never recovering any of it. Let’s compare that
to actual losses under real, actual market stress.

Now consider these historical data points: First, over the last 10 years, the firm’s
market-making business has never had a quarterly loss and has lost money
on only 30 trading days. These loss days represent only 1% of total trading days, and
the average loss on those days was $90 million. Second, when markets completely
collapsed during the COVID-19 pandemic (from March 2 through March 31, 2020,
the stock market fell 16%, and bond spreads gapped out dramatically), J.P. Morgan’s
market-making activities made money every day prior to the Federal Reserve’s major
interventions, which stabilized the markets. During that entire month, we lost money
on only two days but made $2.5 billion in Markets revenue for the month. And third,
in the worst quarter ever in the markets following the 2008 failure of Lehman
Brothers, we lost $1.7 billion, but we made $5.6 billion in Markets revenue for the full
year. The firm as a whole did not lose money in any quarter that year. In 2009, there
was a complete recovery in Markets, and we made $22 billion in Markets revenue.

You can see that our actual performance under extreme stress isn’t even close to the
hypothetical losses of the stress test.

Another major fallacy is that derivatives are objects of financial destruction. In reality,
derivatives are an essential part of managing financial risk and are used by investors,
corporations, farmers, businesses, countries, governments and others to manage
their risks. And more than 85% of derivatives are fairly basic forms of foreign
exchange or interest rate swaps.

One last fallacy is that the repo markets are all about speculation. While it’s true that
repo is used by certain investors to leverage up their positions, about 75% of repo is
essential to normal money market functioning, i.e., is done by broker-dealers
financing their actual inventory positions, money market funds investing their cash
backed by highly rated collateral and clients hedging their positions.

Market makers add confidence, liquidity and transparency to U.S. capital
markets — market making helps stabilize markets and can reduce volatility.

In addition, more liquidity, not less liquidity, will be needed to maintain market
stability. Large banks keep an inventory of securities they can deploy in times of
stress to help soothe markets; however, with the implementation of new regulations,
banks now hold 70% as much inventory in securities as they did before the 2008
financial crisis, while the total size of the market has almost tripled. Higher capital
requirements will accelerate this trend even further, impacting banks’ ability to
deliver support to clients and markets in times when it is needed the most.

Washington’s Basel III endgame proposal damages market making, hurts
Americans and drives activity to less transparent, less regulated markets.

If this proposal is enacted as drafted:

   •   Everyday consumer goods could be impacted. Households contending with
       inflation could also feel the effects of higher capital requirements on market-
       making activities when they shop. From beverage companies that need to
       manage aluminum costs to farms that need to protect against environmental
       risks, if the cost of hedging those risks increases, it could be reflected in what
       consumers pay for everything from a can of soda to meat products.
   •   Mortgages and small business loans will be more expensive. Consumers
       seeking a mortgage — including first-time homebuyers and historically
       underserved, low- to moderate-income borrowers with smaller down
       payments — will face higher interest rates or will have a tougher time
       accessing one. This will occur not only because the cost of originating and
       holding these loans is higher but also because the cost of securitizing them
       will rise for banks, nonbanks and government agencies. Not only that, but the
       proposal will likely lead to reductions in the size of unfunded credit card lines,
       which will put pressure on FICO scores and thereby make it more difficult for
       some people to access other forms of retail credit such as mortgages. Again,
       this will have the greatest impact on low- to moderate-income borrowers who
       rely most heavily on credit cards for day-to-day spending and to build their
       credit history. It could even be argued that existing regulations go too far and
       that there is an opportunity to help underserved communities by dialing down
       regulations that lead to higher borrowing costs. This should be studied and
       the pros and cons analyzed. The same can be said for small business loans,
       which will become more expensive and less accessible.
   •   Saving for retirement or college will be harder. The cost of products that
       families count on to save for retirement or college will go up as a result of this
       proposal. Asset managers, money market funds and pension funds all buy, sell
       and safekeep securities and other financial instruments for American investors.
       Under the proposed rules, the cost of banking products used on behalf of

         clients each day — including brokerage, advisory, clearing and custody
         services — will go up and feed through to customers. That will lead to lower
         returns on retirement accounts, college funds and other long-term savings.
     •   Government infrastructure projects and corporate development will
         become more expensive. Federal, state and local governments, as well as
         corporations and other institutions, rely on large banks for access to U.S.
         capital markets to fund development. If accessing capital markets becomes
         more expensive, it will have a ripple effect on the hiring of American workers,
         investment in research and development, and funding to build hospitals,
         roads and bridges, including the planned infrastructure projects from the
         Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

More market activity will move to unregulated institutions, out of sight from
regulators and without the same level of consumer protections that Americans
expect from their banks. Other market participants that don’t have holistic client
relationships are less likely to provide liquidity to help stabilize markets.

In volatile times, banks have been able to intermediate to help their clients and to
work with the regulators. With new regulations, they may be less able to do so. There
have been several times in the past few years where banks had ample liquidity and
capital but were unable to rapidly increase their intermediation in the markets due to
very rigid liquidity and capital requirements. Finally, the proposed rules increase the
chance that the Federal Reserve will have to step in again — and this is not
something they should want to do on a regular basis but only in an extreme
emergency.

Staying Competitive in the Shrinking Public Markets
In previous letters, I have described the diminishing role of public companies in the
American financial system. From their peak in 1996 at 7,300, U.S. public companies
now total 4,300 — the total should have grown dramatically, not shrunk. Meanwhile,
the number of private U.S. companies backed by private equity firms — which does
not include the rising number of companies owned by sovereign wealth funds and
family offices — has grown from 1,900 to 11,200 over the last two decades. This
trend is serious and may very well increase with more regulation and litigation
coming. Along with a frank assessment of the regulation landscape, we really need to
consider: Is this the outcome we want?

There are good reasons for private markets, and some good outcomes result from
them. For example, companies can stay private longer if they wish and raise more
and different types of capital without going to the public markets. However, taking a
wider view, I fear we may be driving companies from the public markets. The reasons
are complex and may include factors such as intensified reporting requirements

(including investors’ growing needs for environmental, social and governance
information), higher litigation expenses, costly regulations, cookie-cutter board
governance, shareholder activism, less compensation flexibility, less capital flexibility,
heightened public scrutiny and the relentless pressure of quarterly earnings.

Along with the universal proxy — which makes it easier to put poorly qualified
directors on a board — the pressures to retreat from the public market are
mounting. In addition, corporate governance principles are becoming more and
more templated and formulaic, a negative trend. For example, proxy advisors may
automatically judge directors unfavorably if they have a long tenure on the board,
without a fair assessment of their actual contributions or experience. Another
example is the constant battle by some proxy advisors who try to split the chairman
and CEO role when there is no evidence this makes a company better off — in fact,
today, lead directors generally hold most of the authorities previously assigned to
the chairman. The governance of major corporations is evolving away from guidance
by governance principles that focus on a company’s relationship to long-term
economic value toward a bureaucratic compliance exercise. Good corporate
governance is critical, and a little common sense would go a long way.

THE PRESSURE OF QUARTERLY EARNINGS COMPOUNDED BY BAD
ACCOUNTING AND BAD DECISIONS

There is something very positive about detailed and disciplined quarterly financial
and operating reporting. But company CEOs and boards of directors should resist the
undue pressure of quarterly earnings, and it is clearly somewhat their fault when they
don’t. However, it is naïve to think that the pressure doesn’t exist because companies
that “disappoint” can face extensive criticism, particularly those with a new or young
CEO. It’s possible for companies to take short-term actions to increase earnings, such
as selling more product cheaply at the end of a quarter, cutting certain investments
that may be terrific but can show accounting losses in the first year or two, or just
deploying more aggressive accounting methods at times. Once shortcuts like this
begin, people all over the company understand that it is okay to “stretch” to meet
your numbers. This could put you on a treadmill to ruin. Obviously, a company
should not resort to these tactics, but it does happen in the public markets — and it’s
probably less likely in the private markets.

THE HIJACKING OF ANNUAL SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS

One of the reasons it is less desirable to be a public company is because of the
spiraling frivolousness of the annual shareholder meeting, which has devolved into
mostly a showcase of grandstanding and competing special interest groups. We
should treat shareholders with tremendous respect — and we do. At JPMorgan
Chase, we are constantly talking with our investors — our directors, our lead director

and our corporate governance experts visit most of our major investors whether they
be direct owners or asset managers who manage the money for others. Meeting with
your shareholders and investors is critical, but the annual shareholder meeting itself
has become ineffective. We should try to come up with a far more constructive
alternative.

THE UNDUE INFLUENCE OF PROXY ADVISORS

There are essentially two main proxy advisors in the United States. One is called
Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), and the second is called Glass Lewis. These
proxy advisors started out providing reams of data from companies to help their
institutional investor clients vote on proxy matters (information on executive
compensation, stock returns, detail on directors, policies and so on). However, they
soon also began to provide advice on how shareholders should vote on proxy
matters. And, in fact, institutional investors generally execute their voting on an ISS
or Glass Lewis platform, which often includes a clear statement of the advisory
service’s position.

I should also point out, because it may be relevant, that ISS is owned by Deutsche
Boerse, a German company, and Glass Lewis is owned by Peloton Capital, a Canadian
private equity firm. I question whether American corporate governance should be
determined by for-profit international institutions that may have their own strong
feelings about what constitutes good corporate governance.

While asset managers and institutional investors have a fiduciary responsibility
to make their own decisions, it is increasingly clear that proxy advisors have
undue influence.

Asset managers (who manage money on behalf of others) and institutional investors
(e.g., pension plans and endowments) may rely on a variety of information sources to
support their valuation decision-making process. While data and recommendations
may form pieces of the information mosaic, their votes should ultimately be based
on an independent application of their own voting guidelines and policies. To the
extent they use recommendations from proxy advisors in their decision-making
processes, they should disclose that they do so and should be satisfied that the
information upon which they are relying is accurate and relevant. However, many
companies would argue that this information is frequently not balanced, not
representative of the full view and not accurate. In addition, companies complain that
they often cannot get the data corrected, and, therefore, a vote may go uncorrected.

Almost all asset managers receive proxy advisor data and recommendations; while
some asset managers vote completely independently of this information, the
majority do not. Most asset managers have formed corporate governance or
stewardship committees that are responsible for their voting, and these committee

positions are often held not by portfolio managers and research analysts (i.e., the
people buying and analyzing the individual securities) but by stewardship experts.
While it is good to have stewardship experts, the reality is that many of these
committees default large portions of what they do to proxy advisors and, more
troubling, make it harder for actual portfolio managers to override this decision
making.

Some have argued that it’s too hard and too expensive to review the large number of
proxies and proxy proposals — this is both lazy and wrong. If issues are important to
a company, they should be important to the shareholder — for the most part, only a
handful of proposals are important to companies.

We are making enhancements to J.P. Morgan Asset Management’s proxy
voting processes to amplify the role of portfolio managers and to address the
perception of asset managers’ reliance on third-party advisor voting
recommendations.

Enhancements to the firm’s internal proxy voting process will include:

   •   More portfolio manager participation in proxy committee decision
       making. The firm has significantly expanded the representation of portfolio
       managers on its North American Proxy Committee in an effort to increase the
       diversity of viewpoints represented on the committee. As part of this change,
       and in recognition that portfolio managers, as fiduciaries, may differ in their
       views on how to vote on particular proposals depending on a mandate’s
       investment strategy and guidelines, we are broadening our capabilities to
       support voting results that may vary across our platform.
   •   Diminished role of proxy advisor recommendations. J.P. Morgan Asset
       Management makes its own independent proxy voting decisions (based on
       deep fundamental research) and stands behind the depth and rigor of its
       processes and historical information advantage. In most cases, the firm will
       only use proxy advisory firms for research, data and technical mechanics of
       vote transmission and not for outsourced recommendations. By the end of
       2024, J.P. Morgan Asset Management generally will have eliminated third-
       party proxy advisor voting recommendations from its internally developed
       voting systems. Additionally, the firm will work with third-party proxy voting
       advisors to remove their voting recommendations from research reports they
       provide to J.P. Morgan Asset Management by the 2025 proxy season.
   •   Other enhancements. We are working to give a company and its
       management even greater access to the ultimate decision makers; to raise
       critical issues to a company as early as possible in a constructive and proactive
       way; and to be willing to tell companies how we have voted once our decision
       is made rather than waiting until votes are finally counted.

Taken together, these steps are designed to respond to a growing perception (and, I
believe, reality) that the asset management industry generally places undue reliance
on proxy advisors in how proxies are voted. We believe these actions will strengthen
our relationships with our clients and with companies while helping to build trust
between shareholders, investors and companies.

THE BENEFITS AND RISKS OF PRIVATE CREDIT

I have already mentioned some of the benefits of private credit, and I’ll now mention
some more. Many people in the private credit arena are very smart and creative and
want to help the companies they invest in navigate through market shoals. They can
move quickly, discreetly and flexibly. Most generally understand that bad accounting
drives bad decisions, and their goal is to make the right decisions for the future of
the company.

On the other hand, not all players are that good. And problems in the private credit
market caused by the bad players can leak onto the good ones, even though private
credit money is locked up for years. If investors feel mistreated, they will cry foul, and
the government will respond by putting a laser focus on the business. It’s a
reasonable assumption that at some point regulations will focus on the private
markets as they do on the public markets.

This scrutiny will include a look at how private credit values its assets, which isn’t as
transparent as public market valuations. In addition, private market loans commonly
lack liquidity in the secondary market and are not generally supported by in-depth
market research.

New financial products that grow extremely rapidly often become an area of
unexpected risk in the markets. Frequently, the weaknesses of new products, in this
case private credit loans, may only be seen and exposed in bad markets, which
private credit loans have not yet faced. When credit spreads gap out, when interest
rates go up and when some leveraged companies suffer in the recession, we will find
out how those loans survive stress testing. In addition, they can create a little bit of
a “credit crunch” for borrowers since it might be hard for private creditors to roll
over loans under those conditions. Under stress conditions, private creditors would
have to charge exorbitant prices that companies simply cannot afford in order to
book the new loan at par. Banks are in a slightly different position.

A BANK’S STRENGTH: PROVIDING FLEXIBLE CAPITAL

Banks generally try to be there for their borrowers in difficult times — striving to roll
over loans, renegotiate terms and raise additional capital. Banks do this for multiple
reasons: They normally feel an obligation to help their clients, they have long-term
relationships and they can commonly earn other sources of revenue from client-

driven transactions. Banks can also flex their capital and lending base as needed by
their clients. This is because a bank can and should make decisions to help
companies through good times and bad, seeking to retain them as long-term clients
across many areas of the bank. They can and do take “losses” that help the client
maintain the franchise. But an asset manager must act as a “fiduciary” of other
people’s money and cannot lend based on a moral obligation or potential future
relationship.

Recently, we have been witnessing a convergence between the public and private
markets. But it’s too soon to say how this ultimately will play out, particularly if we go
through a recessionary cycle.

Management Lessons: Thinking, Deciding and Taking Action
– Deliberately and with Heart
I always enjoy sharing what I’ve learned from watching others, reading and
experiencing through my own journey.

BENEFITING FROM THE OODA LOOP

The military, which often operates in extreme intensity of life and death and in the
fog and uncertainty of war, uses the term “OODA loop” (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act

— repeat), a strategic process of constant review, analysis, decision making and
action. One cannot overemphasize the importance of observation and a full
assessment — the failure to do so leads to some of the greatest mistakes, not only in
war but also in business and government.

A full assessment is critical.

To properly manage any business situation, you need to perform a full and complete
assessment of it. In business, you have to understand your competitors, their
distribution, their economics, their innovations, and their strengths and weaknesses.
You also need to understand customers and their changing preferences, along with
your own costs, your people and their skills. Then there’s knowing how other factors
fit in, like technology, risk, motivations … hope you get the point. For countries, you
need a thorough grasp of their economies, strengths and weaknesses, population
and education, access to raw materials, laws and regulations, history and culture.
Research, data and analytics should be at a very detailed level and constantly
reassessed. Only after you complete this diligent study can you start to make plans
with a high degree of success.

Get on the road – it builds knowledge and culture.

I have frequently wondered about all the nonstop road trips, client meetings,
briefings, greetings, bus trips, and visits to call centers, operating centers and
branches, regulators and government officials, among others: Did they make a
difference? The answer is absolutely yes because they enabled a process of constant
learning, assessment and modification of best practices — gaining insights from
employees to clients to competitors. Employees will tell you what you are doing well
or poorly if you simply ask them, and they know you want to hear the real answer.
Curiosity is a form of humility — acknowledging that you don’t know everything.
Responding to curiosity allows other people to speak freely. Facts and details matter
and inform a deeper and deeper analysis that allows you to continually revise and
update your plans. This, of course, also means that you are constantly admitting prior
mistakes.

You need to shed sacred cows, seek out blind spots and challenge the status
quo.

Very often companies or individuals develop narratives based upon beliefs that are
very hard to dislodge but are often wrong — and they can lead to terrible mistakes.
A few examples will suffice. Stripe, Inc. built a payments business by working with
developers — something we never would have imagined but might have figured out
if we had tried to seek out what others were doing in this area. Branches were being
closed, both at Bank One and Chase, because the assumption was that they would
not be needed in the future. We underinvested for years in the wealth management

business because we were always focused on the value of deposits versus
investments. Question everything.

Use your brains to figure out the truth — not to justify what you already think.

It’s often hard to change your own attitudes and beliefs, especially those you may
have held on to for some time. But you must be open to it. When you learn
something that is different from what you thought, it may affect many conclusions
you have, not just one. Try not to allow yourself to become rigid or “weaponized,”
where other employees or interest groups jazz you up so much that you become a
weapon on their behalf. This makes it much harder to see things clearly for yourself.
When people disagree with you, seek out where they may be partially right. This
opens the door for a deeper understanding and avoids binary thinking.

It's hard to see certain long-term trends, but you must try.

There is too much emphasis on short-term, monthly data and too little on long-term
trends and on what might happen in the future that would influence long-term
outcomes. For example, today there is tremendous interest in monthly inflation data,
although it seems to me that every long-term trend I see increases inflation relative
to the last 20 years. Huge fiscal spending, the trillions needed each year for the green
economy, the remilitarization of the world and the restructuring of global trade — all
are inflationary. I’m not sure models could pick this up. And you must use judgment
if you want to evaluate impacts like these.

Also, a block of time as short as one year is an artificial framework for judging the
impact of long-term trends that could easily play out over years. A helpful exercise is
to think “future back,” in which you imagine different future outcomes, including the
ones you want, and then work backward to events that are happening today (or that
might happen or that you cause to happen), closely examining the connections
between those events and your projected or desired outcomes. Those connections
inform your risk and R&D planning. Similarly, when companies compare the
attributes of their products and services with their competitors, they usually only
consider where they are versus their competitors. But nothing is static — they should
consider where their competitors will be in the future. Conditions are always
changing, crises are always emerging. When analyzing the playing field, it is better to
assume that your competitors are strong and are already in the process of improving
and innovating. This minimizes the chance of arrogance leading to complacency.

DECISION MAKING AND ACTING (HAVE A PROCESS)

There is a time for an individual to decide and act.

Sometimes you should take the time to measure twice and cut once. And then
sometimes making a quick decision is better than delaying. You should try to
distinguish between the two. For example, with decisions that are hard to reverse, it’s
usually better to go slow. With other decisions where you can test, learn, probe and
change direction, it’s often better to go fast. It’s been my experience that it’s hard for
some people to actually decide and act. This could be from analysis paralysis, lack of
“perfect” information, fear of failure or the feeling that full consensus is needed
before a decision can be reached. But whatever it is, it can slow down and possibly
seriously damage a company.

To get people to think like decision makers and take a strong point of view, we like
to ask, “What would you do if you were king or queen for a day?” It helps shift the
direction to individual decision making. We also ask questions like, “What would you
wish for if you knew X was going to happen?” (for example, higher interest rates).
Decision making takes a mix of courage, grit and guts.

One exercise that I find useful (and sometimes painful) is to draw up a list of
important decisions that need to be made — the ones I often avoid confronting. So I
take time every Sunday to think about these tough issues and almost always make
progress. Progress doesn’t always mean that you come to the final conclusion —
sometimes it’s just a very rational next step that can put you on a path to the final
decision.

Try to have a good decision-making process.

Try to give yourself the time to decide. Make sure you speak with the right people
and make sure the right people are in the room. Information should be fully shared.
People should be made very comfortable with open debate. Quite often, the “right”
answer is simply waiting to be found — you don’t have to guess.

Crowdsourcing, compromise, consensus and committees have benefits and
risks.

There are huge benefits to crowdsourcing intelligence. It is a form of full assessment,
a strategy for getting the best ideas and challenging the status quo. We should do
this for almost every major decision. It is perfectly fine on some occasions to
compromise and gain consensus, particularly on decisions that are not critical and
can easily be reversed. Often people spend too much time debating issues that are
simply not that important; it’s better to decide and move on. Also, before you
compromise, you should know exactly what you want to achieve and the
consequences of any tradeoffs. However, sometimes compromise and consensus
cannot work and only lead to a feel-good decision that is probably wrong — this
could be the road to ruin.

The use of committees can be good when done properly. For example, if our risk
committees could do a full assessment and crowdsource all potential risks, that
would lead to better decision making. I will give one very personal and painful
example, which is when we had a major trading scandal, called The London Whale.
The scandal was not caused by the complexity of the trade but rather the failure to
go to the proper Risk committee for a thorough review, which should have happened
but didn’t. I have no doubt that had the trade been raised there, the flaws would
have been exposed immediately, thereby dramatically reducing or eliminating the
problem. On the other hand, the opposite can happen when a committee, with
everyone staring at each other, devolves into herd-like behavior with people looking
for confirmation and ending up with a compromise that is a poor choice.

Good leadership involves great observation and the ability to act, but there is more …

THE SECRET SAUCE OF LEADERSHIP (HAVE A HEART)

You need to earn trust and respect with your employees.

You can be great at assessment, you can be brilliant and you may often be willing to
act. But all of that is not good enough for “complete” leadership. To become a true
leader, you need to be trusted and you must earn your respect, every day. People
have to know that you do not have ulterior motives and that you’re trying to do the
right thing — not trying to burnish your personal reputation. Good people want to
work for people they respect, and they will not respect people who take all the credit
and share all the blame. People need to know that even when you make mistakes,
you’re willing to admit them and take corrective action. And there is more …

The importance of vision, communication and inspiration.

The reason I’ve always hesitated to talk about “vision” is because often it is the basic
BS of corporate speak — that somehow if you impart your vision to people, they will
take the mountain. What it really is all about is this: After you’ve done your full
assessment and decision making, you can then continuously educate, explain, train,
simplify, propel and fight. But this only works if people know you are in the trenches
with them, if they understand the mission and if they are there side by side with your
effort.

We know that bureaucracy can lead to politics, corporate stasis and terrible
decisions. So you can communicate your vision about how to fight bureaucracy by
telling stories about the silly things we do — but with a smile — and then by
showing people that you will actually fix the problems.

Finally, your vision needs to be clear, coherent and consistent. Within an
organization, people very quickly pick up the pattern of management saying one

thing but doing another. Because if words and actions are inconsistent (for example,
and I could give many, when we say we want employees to be treated with respect,
but we allow a jerk to be their boss), confidence in leadership will be eroded.

Heart cannot be overstated.

Heart matters. And it makes a difference when people know and see that you actually
care. One example: Many years ago when I was new to JPMorgan Chase, I learned
that the company’s security guards had been outsourced — to save money. Since
after outsourcing, when the same guards continued coming to work every day at the
same salary, I wondered, “How could this be?” (FYI, this was brought to my attention
by the head of the Service Employees International Union, who came to see me over
the objection of my management team.) The reason we were saving money is
because the healthcare benefits were cut in half for the guards and their family
members (currently worth approximately $15,000 a year), and the savings were split
with us. This was a heartless thing to do — and the second I found out, I reversed the
decision. JPMorgan Chase’s success will not be built off the backs of our guards — it
will be the result of fair treatment of all of our employees — and we’re thankful that
many of those guards are still with our company today.

You know heart and soul when you see it in effect on sports teams or with “the boys
in the boat” — it’s a beautiful thing to watch. It’s not as obvious, but it happens in
business, too.

It’s essential to build trust with your customers, constituencies and, yes, even
competitors.

Of course, I’m not bringing this up as a matter of corporate governance or a
corporation’s purpose: A business should, over the long run, try to maximize
shareholder value. It is completely obvious that running a decent business —treating
everyone ethically and earning trust and respect in all your communities — is not
only fundamental to shareholder value but also to a healthy society.
05
A Pivotal Moment for America and the Free Western World:
Strategy and Policy Matter
In past years, I have written extensively about public policy issues. It is important to
engage in these conversations, particularly around domestic economic policy
because policy matters. While JPMorgan Chase can execute specific plans to
improve outcomes for customers and communities, there is no replacement for
effective government policies that add to the general well-being of the country. A
stronger and more prosperous country will make us a stronger company.

As CEO of this company, every year I visit numerous countries around the globe. I
meet with foreign government leaders, presidents and prime ministers, business
leaders, and civic and academic experts, which allows me to learn a significant
amount about how public policy is executed around the world. It also reinforces
some of the critical values and virtues that are essential to a healthy country.

Every time I see the American flag, it reminds me of the values and virtues of this
country and its founding principles conceived in liberty and dedicated to the notion
that all men and women are created equal. Talk with someone who has recently
become a naturalized citizen or watch a ceremony where groups of people take the
oath to America, and you will see extraordinary joy and newfound pride. They now
live free, with individual rights protected by the Constitution and with their life and
the well-being of their family and community protected by the U.S. military. As
Americans, we have much to be grateful for and much to defend.

If you read the newspaper from virtually any day of any year since World War II, there
is abundant coverage on wars — hot and cold — inflation, recession, polarized
politics, terrorist attacks, migration and starvation. As appalling as these events have
been, the world was generally on a path to becoming stronger and safer. When
terrible events happen, we tend to overestimate the effect they will have on the
global economy. Recent events, however, may very well be creating risks that could
eclipse anything since World War II — we should not take them lightly.

February 24, 2022 is another day in history that will live in infamy. On that day,
190,000 Russian soldiers invaded a free and democratic European country —
importantly, somewhat protected by the threat of nuclear blackmail. Russia’s invasion
of Ukraine and the subsequent abhorrent attack on Israel and ongoing violence in
the Middle East should have punctured many assumptions about the direction of
future safety and security, bringing us to this pivotal time in history. America and the
free Western world can no longer maintain a false sense of security based on the
illusion that dictatorships and oppressive nations won’t use their economic and
military powers to advance their aims — particularly against what they perceive as
weak, incompetent and disorganized Western democracies. In a troubled world, we
are reminded that national security is and always will be paramount, even if its
importance seems to recede in tranquil times.

The fallout from these events should also lay to rest the idea that America can stand
alone. Of course, U.S. leaders must always put America first, but global peace and
order are vital to American interests. Only America has the full capability to lead and
coalesce the Western world, though we must do so respectfully and in partnership
with our allies. Without cohesiveness and unity with our allies, autocratic forces will
divide and conquer the bickering democracies. America needs to lead with its
strengths — not only its military but also its economic, diplomatic and moral forces.

And now we must do so as America’s leadership is being challenged around the
world. There is nothing more important.

Policy and strategy matter, and it’s important to be engaged.

In our increasingly complex world, there is a vital interrelationship between domestic
and foreign economic policy, particularly around trade, investment, national security
and other issues. And, of course, while American voters and leadership set U.S.
foreign policy, being a constructive part of the global conversation has become more
important than ever.

If you doubt how important public policy is for the health of a country, you need to
look no further than the recent history of Greece, Ireland or Singapore. Each of these
countries, starting from deeply challenging places, implemented effective
government and policies that have done a great job of lifting up their people when
many thought it wasn’t possible. Sweden is another great example of a country with
good broad-based policies that have succeeded at precisely what we all may want —
a dynamic, innovative, free-market economy (Sweden actually has fewer
government-owned enterprises than America) and safety nets that work. Conversely,
you need to look no further than North Korea or Venezuela to see the complete
destruction and havoc that terrible public policies (often in the name of the people)
can cultivate.

Strategy by its nature must be comprehensive. In the rest of this section, I try to
answer the question: What must we do to ensure that the world stays safe, not only
for America but for freedom and democracy? A comprehensive strategy entails four
important pillars, and we must succeed at each:

   1.   Maintain American leadership (including military).
   2.   Achieve long-term economic success with our allies.
   3.   Strengthen our nation domestically.
   4.   Deepen focus and resolve on addressing our most pressing challenges.
COALESCING THE WESTERN WORLD — A UNIQUELY AMERICAN TASK

Only America has the full capabilities of military might, economic power and the
principles that most people around the world yearn for — based on “liberty and
justice for all” and the proposition that all people are created equal. America remains
the bastion of freedom and the arsenal of democracy.

There is no alternative to American leadership.

In the free and democratic Western world, and, in fact, for many other countries,
there is no real or good alternative to America. The only other potential superpower
is China. Other nations know they can rely on the founding principles of America. If

we reach out our hand, most nations will happily take that hand. America is still the
most prosperous nation on the planet, which not only can guarantee our military
strength but also positions us to help our allies develop and grow their nations
(though we should minimize the “our way or the highway” type of behavior). This
leadership is needed today to help Ukraine stay free in its battle with Russia.

Most of the world wants American leadership.

America continues to be the envy of much of the world, and as we’ve seen with the
challenges at our borders, there is a reason people want to come here and not to
autocratic nations. If you opened America’s borders to the rest of the world, I have
little doubt that hundreds of millions of people would want to move here. By
contrast, not many would want to emigrate to autocratic nations. Also, I have little
doubt that if most investors across the globe could only invest in one country, they
would choose the United States. Beyond our country’s borders, people and nations
around the world understand the role that America has played in promoting world
peace — known as Pax Americana. For the most part, Pax Americana has kept the
world relatively peaceful since World War II and helped lead to enormous global
economic prosperity, which has helped lift 1.3 billion people out of poverty.

Modern America does not engage in economic coercion or foreign wars to steal land
or treasure. The fact that some of our foreign excursions might have been misguided
does not negate this. We helped rebuild Europe and Japan after the devastation of
World War II, and we, with our allies, have helped create global institutions to
maintain peace. We are still trusted.

First and foremost, the Western world needs unquestioned military might —
peace through strength.

“We know only too well that war comes not when the forces of freedom are strong,
but when they are weak,” said Ronald Reagan in 1980.

So far, the Western world has done a good job in strengthening military alliances in
response to the war in Ukraine. Ukraine is essentially the front line that needs
immediate support. Providing that support is the best way to counter autocratic
forces that would seek to weaken the Western world, particularly America. But the
ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East could become far worse and spread in
unpredictable ways. Most important, the specter of nuclear weapons — probably still
the greatest threat to mankind — hovers as the ultimate decider, which should strike
deep fear in all our hearts. The best protection starts with an unyielding resolve to do
whatever we need to do to maintain the strongest military on the planet — a
commitment that is well within our economic capability.

American leadership requires not only the military but also the full “symphony
of power.”

Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, in his book Exercise of Power, writes
extensively in the first chapter about “the symphony of power.” He makes the critical
point that America has often overused and misused military power and has massively
underused other muscles — diplomacy, intelligence, communication (explaining to
the world the benefits of democracy and free enterprise) and comprehensive
economic policy.

America has the most extensive group of partners, friends and allies — both military
and economic — that the world has probably ever seen. We should put this to better
use.

The American public ought to hear more about why this is so important.

International isolationism has run through American foreign policy throughout our
history, frequently with good reason. The chant, “Don’t get involved in foreign wars”
was often right. That said, the American public should remember that even after the
Revolutionary War, we did, in fact, have British and French armies on our soil. The
sinking of American merchant and passenger ships during World War I and the
surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in World War II brought isolationism to a close for a
time. America is never far from being dragged into terrible conflicts. Global wars
come to our shores whether we like it or not — we need to stay engaged.

In perilous periods of history when our allies and other democracies were under
serious assault, great American leaders have inspired the American people —
through words and actions — to stand up to help and defend them. Staying on the
sidelines during battles of autocracy and democracy, between dictatorship and
freedom, is simply not an option for America today. Ukraine is the front line of
democracy. If the war goes badly for Ukraine, you may see the splintering of Pax
Americana, which would be a disaster for the whole free world. Ukraine’s struggle is
our struggle, and ensuring their victory is ensuring America first. It is imperative that
our national leaders explain to the American people what is at stake and make a
powerful case – with energy, consistency and clarity – for our strong enduring
commitment to Ukraine’s survival for as long as it takes (and it could take years).

One last point: Ukraine needs our help immediately, but it’s important to understand
that much of the money that America is directing to Ukraine is for purchasing
weapons and equipment, most of which will be built in America. Not only is our aid
helping Ukraine, but it is going directly to American manufacturers, and it is helping
the country rebuild our military industrial capacity for the next generation.

STRENGTHENING OUR POSITION WITH A COMPREHENSIVE, GLOBAL
ECONOMIC SECURITY STRATEGY

Sustaining America’s economic strength is a bedrock for our long-term military
strength. There are many things we need to do to strengthen the U.S. economy, and I
talk about that later in this section. This discussion is about foreign economic policies
– the economic battlefield.

The whole Western world is rethinking and reimagining its military strategies and
alliances. We need to do the same for our economic strategies and alliances, but we
should be guided by a comprehensive global strategy that deals with critical issues.
Done properly, such a strategy would help strengthen, coalesce and possibly be the
glue that holds together Western democratic alliances over decades.

Foreign economic policy involves trade and investment, export controls, secure and
resilient supply chains, and the execution of sanctions and any related industrial
policies. It must also include development finance — think of the “Belt and Road”
efforts in China — which are critical to most developing nations. This framework
should tell us not only how to deal with our allies but also how to work with
nonaligned nations around the world. These strategies should not be aimed against
any one country (such as China) but rather be focused on keeping the world safe for
democracy and free enterprise.

Economic national security is paramount — both for the United States and for
our allies.

It is a valid point that the Western world — both government and business —
essentially underestimated the growing strength and potential threat of China. It’s
also true that China has been comprehensively and strategically focused on these
economic issues, all while we slept. But let’s not cry over spilled milk — let’s just fix it.

We missed the potential threat from three vantage points. The first is companies’
overreliance on China as the sole link in their supply chain, which can create
vulnerabilities and reduces resiliency. But to the extent this involves everyday items,
like clothes, sneakers, vaccine compounds and consumer goods, this dependency is
not as critical or complex and will eventually be sorted out.

The second is the most critical. The United States cannot rely on any potential
adversaries for materials essential to our national security — think rare earths, 5G
and semiconductors, penicillin and materials critical to essential pharmaceuticals,
among others. We also cannot be sharing vital technologies that can enhance an
adversary’s military capabilities. The United States should properly and narrowly
define these issues and then act unilaterally, if necessary, to fix them.

The third is also complex, which is countering unfair competition or “mercantilist”
behavior in critical industries; think electric vehicles, renewable energy and AI, among
others. Examples of this would be where a state, any state, uses government powers,
capital, subsidies or other means to dominate critical industries and deeply damage
the economic position of other nations. Weakening a country economically can
render it a virtual “vassal state,” reliant on potential adversaries for essential goods
and services, which also weakens it militarily. We cannot cede our important
resources and capabilities to potential adversaries.

All these issues can be resolved, though they will take time and need devoted effort.

Every nation will have different national security issues. For example, Europe in
general and countries like India, Japan and Korea need reliable, affordable and secure
energy; many nations would put food security as their top concern. This means that
we must work with our allies to accomplish our own goals and to help them
accomplish theirs. We have extraordinary common interests in our joint security: We
must hang together — because if we don’t, we will assuredly hang separately.

We already engage in trade — improving it is good economics and great
geopolitics.

We must have a better understanding of trade. As a nation, we refuse to get into
genuine trade discussions, but this ignores the complete and obvious truth — we
already have trade relationships with all these countries. Approximately 92% of the
world’s consumers live outside the United States. Increased trade allows our workers
and farmers to access those markets. We should negotiate trade agreements that can
achieve more, economically, for ourselves and our allies, as well as meet all of our
national security needs. While it is appropriate to use trade to continue to nudge
allies in the right direction around human rights and climate, this objective should be
subordinated to our national interests of long-term security.

Negotiating must be done in concert with our allied nations so as not to cause a
fissure in economic relations. This is critical — strong economic bonds will help
ensure strong military alliances. The Inflation Reduction Act has much good in it
(more on this later), but it angered many of our allies. To them, the bill was by
America and for America, and, subsequently, they felt a need to match it so their
businesses would not be disadvantaged. The terms of the legislation could have
been better negotiated with our allies in mind, strengthening our economic ties with
the free world.

We should also immediately re-enter, if possible, the prior negotiated Trans-Pacific
Partnership agreement. Not only is it good for the economy, but it also could be
a brilliant, strategic, economic security move — an economic alliance that binds
us with 11 other important countries (including Australia, Chile, Japan, Malaysia,

Mexico, Singapore and Vietnam). Geopolitically and strategically, this might be one
of the most important moves to counter China. While this is a challenging step, our
political leaders need to explain and lead — and not be afraid of dealing with the
tough issues. We also need to acknowledge that there have been real negative job
impacts as a result of trade, which are usually concentrated around certain areas and
businesses. So any new trade policy should be combined with a greatly enhanced
Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which provides retraining, income assistance
and relocation for those workers directly impacted by trade.

Trade is realpolitik, and the recent cancellation of future liquified natural gas (LNG)
projects is a good example of this fact. The projects were delayed mainly for political
reasons — to pacify those who believe that gas is bad and that oil and gas projects
should simply be stopped. This is not only wrong but also enormously naïve. One of
the best ways to reduce CO2 for the next few decades is to use gas to replace coal.
When oil and gas prices skyrocketed last winter, nations around the world — wealthy
and very climate-conscious nations like France, Germany and the Netherlands, as well
as lower-income nations like Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam that could not
afford the higher cost — started to turn back to their coal plants. This highlights the
importance of safe, secure and affordable energy. Second, the export of LNG is a
great economic boon for the United States. But most important is the realpolitik
goal: Our allied nations that need secure and affordable energy resources, including
critical nations like Japan, Korea and most of our European allies, would like to be
able to depend on the United States for energy. This now puts them in a difficult
position — they may have to look elsewhere for such supplies, turning to Iran, Qatar,
the United Arab Emirates or maybe even Russia. We need to minimize anything that
can tear at our economic bonds with our allies.

The strength of our domestic production of energy gives us a “power advantage” —
cheaper and more reliable energy, which creates economic and geopolitical
advantages.

Industrial policy is now necessary, but it should be carefully constructed and
limited.

In some cases, industrial policy (using government resources to subsidize
investments to help make businesses more competitive) may be the only solution for
quickly building up the industries we need (rare earths and semiconductors, among
others) to guarantee resilient national security. The IRA and CHIPS Act are good
examples of this and government has to get it right.

Such policy can also be used to help combat unfair competitive policies of nations
that are using state capitalism and state control to dominate critical industries.
However, when crafting industrial policy, the function of government needs to be
narrowly defined and kept simple; i.e., governmental jurisdiction should be limited to

very specific products and probably to what we know works, such as tax credits and,
to a lesser extent, loan guarantees. And industrial policy should include twin
provisions: 1) strict limitations on political interference, like social policies, and 2)
specific permitting requirements, which, if not drastically improved, will badly inhibit
our ability to make investments and allow infrastructure to be built. Adding social
policy, politics and matters other than simple tax credits dramatically reduces the
economic efficiency of industrial policy and creates conditions for corporate America
to feed at the trough of government largess. We should quickly address how we can
improve on already executed legislation. We do not want to look back and have
great regrets about how so much of this policy work failed.

There are those who argue that the U.S. government needs much more far-reaching
industrial policy to be able to micromanage and accomplish its many ambitious
objectives. To those I say, read further in this section about how ineffective so many
government policies have been.

We should be tough, but we should engage with China.

Over the last 20 years, China has been executing a more comprehensive economic
strategy than we have. The country’s leaders have successfully grown their nation
and, depending on how you measure it, have the first or second largest economy in
the world. That said, many question the current economic focus of China’s leadership
as they don’t have everything figured out. While China has become the largest
trading partner to many countries around the world, its own GDP per person is
$13,000. And the country continues to be beset by many economic and domestic
issues.

China has its own national security concerns. The country is located in a very
politically complex part of the world, and many of China’s actions have caused its
neighbors (e.g., Japan, Korea, Philippines, among others) to start to re-arm and, in
fact, draw closer to the United States. It also surprises many Americans to hear that
while our country is 100% energy sufficient, China needs to import 10 million barrels
of oil a day. It is clear that China’s new leadership has set a different course, with a
much more intense focus on national security, military capability and internal
development. That is their right, and we simply need to adjust to it.

America still has an enormously strong hand — plenty of food, water and energy;
peaceful neighbors; and what remains the most prosperous and dynamic economy
the world has ever seen, with a per person GDP of over $80,000 a year. Most
important, our nation is blessed with the benefit of true freedom and liberty. See the
sidebar on the amazing power of freedom later in this section.

While we may always have a complex relationship with China (made all the more
complicated and serious by ongoing wars), the country’s vast size and importance to

so many other nations requires us to stay engaged — thoughtfully and without fear.
At the same time, we need to build and execute our own long-term, comprehensive
economic security strategy to keep our position safe and secure. I believe that
respectful, strong and consistent engagement would be best for both our countries
and the rest of the world.

We need to strengthen and rebuild the international order — we may need a
new Bretton Woods.

The international rules-based order established by the Western world after World
War II is clearly under attack by outside forces, somewhat weakened by its own
failures and inability to keep up with the increasingly complex world. This
international order relies on a web of military alliances, trade agreements (e.g., World
Trade Organization), development finance (e.g., International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank) and related global tax and investment policies and diplomacy
organizations (e.g., United Nations), which have evolved into a confusing and
overlapping regime of policies. You can now add to it the new issues of cyber
warfare, digital trade and privacy, and global taxes, among others.

It might be a good idea to convene a group of like-minded leaders to build and
improve upon what already exists. The time may be right for a reimagined Bretton
Woods — and by this, I mean revitalizing our global architecture. Since too many
parts of the world have been neglected, any new system has to take into account and
properly address the needs of all nations, including areas of concentrated poverty.

While we hope the wars in Ukraine and in the Middle East will end eventually (and,
we hope, successfully from the standpoint of our allies), these other critical economic
battles could possibly continue throughout our lifetime. If the Western world is
slowly split apart over the next few decades, it will likely be the result of our failure to
effectively address crucial global economic challenges.

PROVIDING STRONG LEADERSHIP GLOBALLY AND EFFECTIVE POLICY
MAKING DOMESTICALLY

When you travel around the United States and talk with people of all types and
persuasions, there is a rather common refrain; namely, why are we helping foreign
nations with the safety of their borders and economies when we are not doing a
particularly good job of protecting our own? While there is no moral equivalency in
these arguments, they are understandable. It is clear that many Americans feel we
need to do a better job here at home before we can focus over there. We can
understand why some people living in this country, who have been neglected for
decades, ask how their government can find the money for Ukraine and other parts
of the world but not for them. It is a reasonable question.

From my point of view, our highly charged, emotional and political domestic issues
are centered around 1) immigration and lack of border security and 2) the fraying of
the American dream, particularly for low-income and rural Americans who feel left
behind amid the growing wealth and prosperity of others around them. Please read
the sidebar below, which I believe explains the legitimate frustration of some of our
citizens. And I agree with them.

In the sidebar, I also explain how two policies (a large expansion of the Earned
Income Tax Credit and focus on work skills and job outcomes at high schools,
community colleges and colleges) would not only dramatically increase both the
income and employment opportunities for many of those left behind but would also
have the virtue of actually growing the workforce. The combined effect of all of this
would be quite a boon to our GDP.

I believe that many affected Americans are not angry at hardworking, law-abiding
immigrants and, in fact, acknowledge the critical role immigrants continue to play in
building this wonderful country. Rather, they are angry that America has not
implemented proper border control and immigration policies. It is astounding that
many in Congress know what to do and want to do it but are simply unable to pass
legislation because of partisan politics. Congress did come close on a few occasions
— and I hope they keep trying.

Deliberate policies meant to drive healthy growth are needed.

For over two decades, since 2000, America has grown at an anemic rate of 2%. We
should have strived for and achieved 3% growth. Had we done so, GDP per person
today would be $16,000 higher, which would, in turn, have paid for better healthcare,
childcare, education and other services. Importantly, the best way to handle our
excess deficit and debt issues is to maximize economic growth.

Growth policies include (the list could be very long so I’ll just mention a few):

   •   Consistent tax policies, conducive to both employment and capital
       investment. Capital investment is the primary driver of innovation,
       productivity and, therefore, growth in America. Tax policies change too
       frequently, which causes uncertainty and complicates long-term capital
       investment decision making (I won’t bore you with the details here). A
       bipartisan committee of Congress is probably required to fix this — and the
       sooner the better.
   •   Well-conceived regulations (and related laws). This requires an ongoing
       concerted effort to streamline regulations to cost-effectively drive better
       outcomes for the United States. The last thing we need is a constant pile-on of
       politically driven, fragmented policies. Please read the sidebar, an editorial
       in The Wall Street Journal by George McGovern, one of the most liberal

presidential nominees in our lifetime, in which he clearly lays out the
complexity, risks and costs that businesses, large and small, face every day.
While he acknowledges the worthiness of the goals of many regulations, he
points out their negatives. He also calls out the “blame-shifting and
scapegoating"" and ""the endless exposure to frivolous claims and high legal
fees.” Not only is this state of affairs demoralizing, but it also reduces
employment, capital investment and the formation of new businesses, as well
as cause unnecessary bankruptcies. Estimates of the regulatory costs for
America are approximately $19,000 per worker, dwarfing the regulatory
burdens in other countries. We all want sensible regulations that make us a
better and safer nation – but this number is astounding. We should be able to
accomplish our goals while sharply reducing needless and wasteful expenses.
And remember, it’s discouraging not only to companies but to all citizens who
have to deal with it on a daily basis.

The Wall Street Journal

   •   Timely permits on projects large and small. There is virtually no industry —
       from agriculture and construction to transportation, technology, and oil and
       gas — or business, large or small, that isn’t disadvantaged by the tedious
       process and the length of time it takes to get approvals for permits to get
       things done. This includes federal, state and local requirements. These
       bottlenecks also make investment far more costly and slow. Timely permits
       would improve infrastructure and save lives, not endanger them.
   •   Proper federal government budgeting and fiscal management. The
       staggering inability of the government to draft and pass a proper budget
       causes deep and unnecessary damage to our growth. Some people estimate
       that the waste alone (due to improper payments, overlapping programs, and
       fragmented and duplicative contracts, among other things) could cost the
       nation hundreds of billions of dollars annually. This uncertainty filters through
       virtually every part of the American economy and should not be accepted.

We can all forgo a little self-interest to do what is right for our country.

Those of us who have benefited the most from this country bear even greater
responsibility to do this. It’s perfectly understandable that institutions, including
businesses, unions and industries, lobby in Washington, D.C., to protect themselves
— in good ways and bad — but we should more regularly put national interests
ahead of self-interests. It’s good to want to ensure well-paying jobs and healthy
industries. But it is not good when it reduces competition, stops the deployment of
enhanced technology, harms efficiency, creates fake jobs or builds bridges to
nowhere or damages the general health of the economy. Doing the right thing, the
right way – which is achievable – would be better for everyone. As former President
John F. Kennedy said, “Ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can
do for your country.”

Celebrate American exceptionalism.

We can safely say that America is an exceptional nation built and grounded on
principles — principles of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, free enterprise
(capitalism), and the freedom and empowerment brought to us by our democracy
through the power to elect our leaders and of our Constitution, which makes these
individual freedoms sacrosanct. Much of the world yearns to be here because of
those principles — the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We should
extol those virtues while recognizing that America has never been a perfect nation,
like all other nations. We can acknowledge our flaws and strive to constantly correct
them, without denigrating our nation.

Let’s celebrate the shared sense of sacrifice that gives us all strength.

There were very few positives from the pandemic, but I’m mentioning one, which,
unfortunately, didn’t last, but reflected the best of us. In New York City, at 7 p.m.
every evening, people throughout the city would open their windows, shouting and
screaming and banging pots and pans to show gratitude to the essential workers —
sanitation workers, police, firefighters, emergency responders, nurses and doctors. Of
course, these workers were always essential, but I was hoping that spirit and civility
would become deeply embedded and have longer lasting effects in our society.

I can understand when an individual for conscientious reasons chooses not to do
work that helps our military. But I cannot understand when an entire company takes
that position. How can we have a sense of shared sacrifice, when America is home to
18 million veterans who were willing to risk their lives for America’s safety, and yet
some companies are not even willing to use their fingertips to help?

For example, back in 1969 the cancellation of the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps
programs by the country’s most prestigious universities and colleges likely fueled the
great divide – between elites and others in our country – that persists today. Our
strength as a nation is best served when the best students and the best soldiers are
brought together and we would all benefit from more civility and better teaching
around basic virtues like hard work, shared sacrifice, justice, rationality and more
respect for the enduring values of American freedom and free enterprise.

Resist being “weaponized.”

We can start by trying to understand other people’s and other voters’ points of
views, even around deeply emotional topics. We can stop insulting whole classes of
voters. We can stop name calling. We can stop blame-shifting and scapegoating. We
can stop being petty. Politicians can cease insulting, baiting and belittling each other,
which diminishes them and the voter. It has also become too acceptable for some
politicians to say one thing in private and deliver a completely different message in
public. It would also be nice to see some cabinet members from the opposing party.
We should also stop degrading and demonizing American business and American
institutions, which are the best in the world, because it erodes confidence in our very
country.

Social media could do more.

There is no question that social media has some real negative effects, from the
manipulation of elections to the increasingly documented negative effects on the
mental health of children. These are issues impacting our individual and collective
spheres, and it’s time for social media companies to take more action to remedy
these challenges — and swiftly. Rapid advances in technology will not only make
these existing issues harder to address, but they will likely create new ones. The
current state of the online information landscape has wide-ranging implications on

trust in institutions, information integrity and more — and it bears on institutions like
ours, where platform policy has increasingly widespread implications for concerns
about fraud, security and other issue spaces.

A range of tools and approaches is required to address this complex and important
situation — and there are several measures that platform companies can
immediately enact, voluntarily, while strengthening and improving their business
models. One common sense and modest step would be for social media companies
to further empower platform users’ control over what they see and how it is
presented, leveraging existing tools and features — like the alternative feed
algorithm settings some offer today. I believe many users (not just parents) would
appreciate a greater ability to more carefully curate their feeds; for example,
prioritizing educational content for their children.

Platforms could also consider enhanced authentication measures; i.e., having users
identify themselves to the platform or to a trusted third party. This would have the
virtue of increasing individual accountability and reducing imposters, bots and
possibly foreign political actors on platforms. It would have immediate benefits for
users who prefer content from authenticated sources that take responsibility for their
postings. There are clear competing values that need to be balanced in such an
approach, including those related to our cherished right to free speech, individual
privacy and inclusion (for example, roughly 850 million people globally don’t have a
way to easily authenticate themselves today). There are also legitimate questions as
to whether authentication would be used as a tool to chill or block speech or quash
bona fide political dissenters, and real work needs to be done to identify policy and
technical solutions that balance such risks and benefits.

I offer these approaches as a starting place, understanding that it's crucial to
continue honest conversation across sectors about the immediate, incremental
improvements we can make to our online public square, considering the high stakes
involved in how information is created and shared.

Effective measures will require time, money, learning and improvement, all in service
of significantly enhancing the well-being, quality, and civility of our experiences
online and in the world around us.

Healthy collaboration with business is needed.

Companies big and small create jobs, pay for employee healthcare and benefits, and
build bridges, roads and hospitals. The people who work for and run these
companies care deeply about their country — they are patriots, and they want to see
people and communities succeed and prosper.

Unfortunately, the message America hears is that the federal government does not
value business — that business is the problem and not part of the solution. There are
fewer individuals in government who have any significant experience in starting or
running a company, which is apparent every day in the political rhetoric that
demonizes businesses and free enterprise and that damages confidence in
American’s institutions. The relationship between business and government, in fact,
might improve if there were more people from the business sector working in
government. Inexperience with business is also evident from the regular lack of
transparency or curiosity from regulators as they develop economic policies with
potentially seismic consequences for the economy.

When I travel around the country, I experience a very different perspective on the
street and at the local level — I see that many governors, mayors and city council
members understand they are not facing big challenges alone. They stand shoulder
to shoulder with our company, even when some of their constituents disagree or are
skeptical about big banks. These government officials know they need partners who
have the same stake in helping successful communities thrive and who care about
building a prosperous future as much as they do. For example, in fewer than 10
years, Detroit saw one of the greatest turnarounds because of a vibrant collaboration
between government and business. And businesses know they cannot succeed if
individuals, families, towns and cities are not flourishing. We obviously don’t agree
on everything, but there is a shared belief that we must work together. We can and
should be full partners in developing solutions to our big problems.

The federal government, regardless of which party is in charge, needs to earn
back trust through competence and effective policymaking.

The world is becoming more complex, more technologically competent and faster.
Unfortunately the government simply is not built to innovate, compete and move
quickly, as in the competitive business world. This may be the reason why
government is becoming less effective. We need to take action on this because the
loss of trust in government is damaging to society. We should be brutally honest
about the staggering number of policies, systems and operations that are
underperforming: Too many ineffective public schools do not give students the skills
they need to land a well-paying job; we have over 25 million uninsured Americans,
soaring healthcare costs and too many bad outcomes; we are unable to plan, permit
and build infrastructure efficiently; our litigation system is capricious and wasteful;
progress on immigration policies and reform is frustrating; lack of efficient mortgage
markets and an affordable housing policy keep housing out of reach for many
Americans; problems plague the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Federal Aviation
Administration and the Internal Revenue Service; public universities don’t take
responsibility for their costs and are often funded by excessive student lending;
underinvestment in the electric grid results in high costs and unreliable service;
highly inefficient U.S. merchant shipping and ports; and we have unfunded pension

plans and no action on deficit spending, Social Security and Medicare. I’ll stop here.
This should be unacceptable to all of us.

We need to find a way to bring more varied expertise and accountability to
government.

We should be more ambitious in striving for excellence in government. I
acknowledge that some of the best and the brightest are in government and the
military today. Yet we should return to a government that seeks out more of the best
and the brightest people from every background, including the private sector, to
benefit from their knowledge and experience. Government also needs to leverage
the expertise of business to address problems that it cannot solve on its own. And to
be fair, business could use its influence to do less to further its own interest and
more to enhance the nation as a whole.

We need good government. And there are some things only governments can do,
such as oversee the military and justice systems. And while most innovation happens
through the private sector, there are certain types of foundational innovations that
can only be advanced by the government, such as basic research that simply cannot
be funded by business. The Democrats want the government to do even more and
the Republicans even less — I think we should spend more time trying to do even
better. But no one, not even my most liberal Democratic friends, thinks that sending
the government another trillion a year would be a wise use of money.

OUT OF THE LABYRINTH, WITH FOCUS AND RESOLVE

Even America, the most prosperous nation on the planet with its vast resources,
needs to focus its resources on the complex and difficult tasks ahead.

I hope to never read a book about How the West Was Lost, summarized as follows:
The failure to save Ukraine and find peace in the Middle East led to more bickering
among the allies and weakened military alliances. This accelerated a division within
the Western world, splitting countries into different economic spheres and with each
nation trying to protect its economy, trade and energy sources. America’s economy
weakened, eventually leading to the loss of its reserve currency status. Besotted by
populism and partisanship and crippled by bureaucracy and lack of willpower,
America failed to focus on what it needed to do to lead and save the Western world.
The enemy was within — we just didn’t see it in time.

Paraphrasing what Winston Churchill was thought to have said: America, after it had
exhausted all other possibilities, would do the right thing.

What I want and hope to see is a book about How the West Was Won. As the wars
in Ukraine and the Middle East dragged on and as the fears of the Western world

mounted, America rose to the challenge as it had in other turbulent times in history.
America coalesced with its allies to form the alliances necessary to keep the world
safe for freedom and democracy.

I remain with a deep and abiding faith in the strength of the enduring values of
America.
WE SHOULD HAVE MORE FAITH IN THE AMAZING POWER OF OUR
FREEDOMS

The heart and soul of the dynamism of America is human freedom — freedom of
speech, freedom of religion, free enterprise (capitalism), and the freedom and
empowerment brought to us by our democracy through the right to elect our
leaders. Free people are at liberty to move around as they see fit, work as they see fit,
dream as they see fit, and invest in themselves and in the pursuit of happiness as
they see fit. This freedom that people enjoy, accompanied by the freedom of capital,
is what drives the dynamism — economic and social — of this great country.

Our civil liberties depend upon the rule of law, property rights, including intellectual
property, and restrictions on government encroachment upon these freedoms. Our
Constitution and Bill of Rights secure our individual freedoms and reserve all rights
to the individual other than those important but limited authorities given to the
government.

The issue of individual rights is not all or none or freedom versus no freedom. There
are, of course, terrible examples where individual rights were trampled upon, and the
results were devastating — both for the individual and for the economy — in East
Germany, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Venezuela, to name a few. And there are many
countries that protect individual rights and are on a spectrum closer to American
values. Think of Europe, for example. But even in some countries that have some of
these rights, a lack of dynamism — often due to bureaucracy, weak institutions and
government, and corruption — is palpable and has clearly led to less innovation,
lower growth and, in general, a lower standard of living.

Freedom must necessarily be joined with the principle of striving toward equal
opportunity. Equal opportunity is what allows individuals to rise to the best of their
ability — it also means unequal outcomes. Equal opportunity is the foundation for
fairness and meritocracy. The fight for equality, which is a good moral goal, should
not damage the rights of the individual and their liberties.

Democracy and freedom are cojoined — together, they make freedom more durable.
Democracy also has a self-correcting element — every four years you get to throw
out leadership if you don’t like them (which you do not see in autocracies). But we all
know that democracy can be sloppy: Maintaining an effective democracy is hard

work. Democracy fosters open debate and compromise, which lead to better
decisions over time (whether in government or in business). Intelligence is effectively
“crowdsourced” with constant feedback. Good public policy comes from good
debate and analytics, guided by reason coupled with a firm understanding of what
you would like the outcomes to be and complemented with an honest assessment of
what is really happening.

Even democracies can become stagnant, bureaucratic and self-perpetuating. Good
government does many admirable things, but admitting to mistakes is often not one
of them. It takes civically engaged citizens and a strong free press to bring sunlight
to issues and keep a nation strong.

Autocratic societies by their nature subjugate the individual to the state. By definition
they are not meritocracies — they are more about “who you know,” and they exist to
perpetuate the existing ruling class. Their decisions are based on a completely
different calculation, and their decision-making process does not encourage and,
therefore, benefit from open debate. Democracy means that it is immoral to
subjugate individual freedoms to state actors other than to protect the existence of
the nation itself.

There are values that many of us hold dear, such as religion, family and country. But
none may be more important than the freedoms that allow us to choose to live our
life as we see fit. We should do more to applaud the virtue and amazing power of
our freedoms.
HOW WE CAN HELP LIFT UP OUR LOW-INCOME CITIZENS AND MEND
AMERICA’S TORN SOCIAL FABRIC

To fix problems, we must first acknowledge them. Despite decades of government
programs and all the moralizing that surrounds them, we have not done a
particularly good job lifting up our low-income fellow citizens. I may be wrong, but I
do believe this is tearing at the social fabric of America and is among the root causes
of the fraying of the American dream.

The gap between low-wage and well-paid workers has been growing dramatically.
From 1979 to 2019, the wage growth of the top 10% was nearly 10 times that of the
bottom 10% — which, basically, had not increased at all. The growth of low-income
workers’ annualized real wages after the pandemic was, for the first time in decades,
higher than the top 60%, but that’s not enough. The net worth for the bottom 25%
of households is $20,800, and the net worth for the bottom 10% is essentially $0. This
makes it increasingly difficult for low-wage workers to support their families. Of the
160 million Americans working today, approximately 40 million are paid less than $15
per hour.

Low-income individuals bear far greater burdens than the rest of us. Nearly 40% of
Americans don’t have $400 in savings to deal with unexpected expenses, such as
medical bills or car repairs, which leads to financial distress. More than 25 million
Americans don’t have medical insurance at all; of these, one in five are in a family
with income below the federal poverty level. People who live in low-income
neighborhoods also tend to have worse health outcomes, including higher rates of
mental health issues, depression and suicide, and a lower life expectancy — as many
as 20 years. Finally, low-income Americans generally experience higher
unemployment and more crime.

No one can claim that the promise of equal opportunity is being offered
to all Americans through our education systems. Students in the lowest
socioeconomic bracket are 50% less likely to attend college than those in the highest
socioeconomic groups. Many inner city schools graduate under 50% of their students
— and even those who graduate may not be well-prepared for the workforce. In
addition, boys growing up in the bottom 10% of family income are 20 times more
likely to be incarcerated. Those who do run afoul of our justice system generally do
not get the second chance that many of them deserve. Their exclusion from the
workforce is not only unfair to them but also results in an estimated $87 billion
average annual cost to the economy.

Too many policies that are wrong — affecting housing and mortgage markets,
healthcare, immigration, regulation, education and student lending, to name a few —
are jeopardizing the opportunity for American citizens to succeed. The people who
suffer the most, throughout all of this, are not high-income individuals. I strongly
believe that these outcomes are destroying the concept of “fair” in America and are
driving populism and diminishing, if not eliminating, trust — not only in government
but in all our institutions. Simply put, the social needs of far too many of our citizens
are not being met. We should never accept these outcomes — we must fix them.

There are two policy changes that I believe can have a dramatic effect on jobs,
growth and equality — and they go a long way toward repairing the frayed American
dream. Let’s start by treating all jobs with respect. Even starter jobs, which are the
first rung on the ladder of opportunity, bring dignity and create better social
outcomes in terms of health, higher household formation and lower crime. Of these
two policy changes, one would better utilize existing resources, and the other would
cost some money. But both would significantly change outcomes for low-income
Americans.

The free one is so blindingly obvious that it’s almost embarrassing to propose. Our
schools (high schools, community colleges and perhaps even four-year colleges)
should take responsibility for outcomes — they should be judged on the quality and
income level of the jobs that their graduates and even non-graduates attain. This
means providing graduating students and other individuals with work skills (in fields

such as advanced manufacturing, cyber, data science and technology, healthcare and
so on) that will lead to better paying jobs. These schools should work with local
businesses to replicate effective programs that are in place — because that is where
the actual jobs are now. This would be good for growth and, as there are so many
examples of successful programs, we already know what to do. With nearly 9 million
job openings and just under 6 million unemployed workers in the United States, job
skills training has never been needed more. We already spend a tremendous amount
of money on education — just not the right way.

The second step is related to the first: Get more income to low-paid workers. While
this one would cost money, it is to me a complete no-brainer since it is an expansion
of an existing program, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which many Democrats
and Republicans already agree upon. Today, the EITC supplements low- to
moderate-income working individuals and couples, particularly with children and
people living in rural areas. For example, a single mother with two children earning
$9 an hour (approximately $20,000 a year) could receive a tax credit of more than
$6,000 at year-end. Workers without children receive a very small tax credit (96% of
all EITC dollars were received by families with children). This should be dramatically
expanded, including eliminating the child requirement from the calculation
altogether. We should convert the EITC to make it more like a negative income
payroll tax, paid monthly. Any tax credit income should not be offset by any other
benefits these individuals already receive (we have to eliminate benefit “cliffs” that
disincentivize work).

An increase in the EITC to a maximum of $10,000 would cost tens of billions a year,
but I have little doubt that these policy changes would do more than anything
else to lift up low-income families and their communities. Well-paying jobs have
been shown to reduce crime, increase household formation, improve health and
reduce addiction. Both of these policies would have the virtue of increasing the
number of people in the workforce. I also have little doubt that this would add to
GDP.

We should attack all our other problems as well, but these two policy changes alone
would dramatically improve our low-income neighborhoods, broadly strengthen the
economy and give more opportunity to deserving citizens. It would restore the
American Dream for many.

In Closing
It’s been 20 years since the Bank One-JPMorgan Chase merger — and it’s been an
extraordinary journey. I can’t even begin to express my heartfelt appreciation and
respect for the tremendous character and capabilities of the management team who
got us through the good times and the bad times to where we stand today. And I

recognize that we all stand on the shoulders of many others who came before us in
building this exceptional company of ours.

I would also like to express my deep gratitude to the 300,000+ employees, and their
families, of JPMorgan Chase. Through these annual letters, I hope shareholders and
all readers have gained a deeper understanding of what it takes to be an “endgame
winner” in a rapidly changing world. More important, I hope you are as proud of
what we all have achieved — as a business, as a bank and as a community investor —
as I am. Thank you for your partnership.

Finally, we sincerely hope to see the world on the path to peace and prosperity.
